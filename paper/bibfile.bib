abstract="The mammalian cortex is divided into architectonic and functionally distinct areas. There is growing experimental evidence that their emergence and development is controlled by both epigenetic and genetic factors. The latter were recently implicated as dominating the early cortical area specification. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that explicitly considers the genetic factors and that is able to explain several sets of experiments on cortical area regulation involving transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6, and fibroblast growth factor FGF8. The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be further refined as more experimental facts become known.",

abstract = "{A hallmark of mammalian evolution is the structural and functional complexity of the cerebral cortex. Within the cerebral cortex, the neocortex, or isocortex, is a 6-layered complexly organized structure that is comprised of multiple interconnected sensory and motor areas. These areas and their precise patterns of connections arise during development, through a process termed arealization. Intrinsic, activity-independent and extrinsic, activity-dependent mechanisms are involved in the development of neocortical areas and their connections. The intrinsic molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of this sophisticated network are not fully understood. In this report (I) and the companion report (II), we present the first lifespan analysis of ipsilateral intraneocortical connections (INCs) among multiple sensory and motor regions, from the embryonic period to adulthood in the mouse. Additionally, we characterize the neocortical expression patterns of several developmentally regulated genes that are of central importance to studies investigating the molecular control of arealization from embryonic day 13.5 to postnatal day (P) 3 (I) and P6 to 50 (II). In this analysis, we utilize novel methods to correlate the boundaries of gene expression with INCs and developing areal boundaries, in order to better understand the nature of gene–areal relationships during development.}",

During embryonic development, axons from the midbrain thalamus build columnar connections to the cortex in the absence of sensory input. Working in mice, Ant{\'o}n-Bola{\~n}os et al. found that these thalamocortical connections are responsible for organizing the somatosensory cortex (see the Perspective by Tiriac and Feller). Organization of the map in the cortex depends on spontaneous calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. Thus, the somatosensory map is sketched out before actual sensory input begins to refine the details.Science, this issue p. 987; see also p. 933The mammalian brain{\textquoteright}s somatosensory cortex is a topographic map of the body{\textquoteright}s sensory experience. In mice, cortical barrels reflect whisker input. We asked whether these cortical structures require sensory input to develop or are driven by intrinsic activity. Thalamocortical columns, connecting the thalamus to the cortex, emerge before sensory input and concur with calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. We show that the columnar organization of the thalamocortical somatotopic map exists in the mouse embryo before sensory input, thus linking spontaneous embryonic thalamic activity to somatosensory map formation. Without thalamic calcium waves, cortical circuits become hyperexcitable, columnar and barrel organization does not emerge, and the somatosensory map lacks anatomical and functional structure. Thus, a self-organized protomap in the embryonic thalamus drives the functional assembly of murine thalamocortical sensory circuits.},

abstract = {Abstract Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in distinct patterns in the forming cortex. EphA7 is expressed early in cortical development, becoming concentrated in anterior and posterior domains, whereas ephrin-A5 is expressed later in corticogenesis, highest in the middle region that has low levels of EphA7. The EphA7 gene produces full-length and truncated isoforms, which are repulsive and adhesive, respectively. Analysis of cortical RNA expression demonstrates that proportions of these isoforms change with time, from a more repulsive mix during embryogenesis to a more permissive mix postnatally. To examine how EphA7 and ephrin-A5 influence the formation of cortical regions, EphA7−/− mice were analyzed. Within the cortex of EphA7−/− mice, the distribution of ephrin-A5 was more extensive, encompassing its usual medial domain but also extending more posteriorly toward the occipital pole. Moreover, relative levels of ephrin-A5 along the cortex's anatomical axes changed in EphA7−/− animals, creating less striking shifts in ligand abundance. Furthermore, in vivo functional studies revealed that EphA7 exerts a repulsive influence on ephrin-A5-expressing cells during corticogenesis. In contrast, EphA7 appears to mediate permissive interactions in the postnatal cortex: the area of somatosensory cortex was significantly reduced in EphA7−/− mice. A similar reduction was present in ephrin-A5−/− animals and a more pronounced decrease was observed in EphA7/ephrin-A5−/− cortex. Taken together, this study supports a role for EphA7 and ephrin-A5 in the establishment and maintenance of certain cortical domains and suggests that the nature of their interactions changes with cortical maturity.

	abstract = {In the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, the thalamocortical axons (TCAs) are organized into clusters that correspond to functional units in the periphery. Around these axons, neurons in layer IV aggregate as barrels. To understand how this organization emerges, we analyzed TCA development in mice that do not form barrels, the monoamine oxidase A knock-out (MAOA-KO), and in MAOA/5-HT1Breceptor double-KO mice, which have a restored barrel field. We show that TCAs already attain cortical layer IV on the day of birth. They are uniformly distributed in this layer from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P2 and secondarily coalesce into barrel domains in layer IV, over a 3 d period (P3{\textendash}P5), with no prepatterning in the deeper layers. In MAOA-KO mice, the uniform distribution of the TC projection is maintained, and no axon clusters emerge. Individual TCA arbors were traced after carbocyanine injections. At P1, TCAs were poorly branched and covered variable tangential widths, encompassing one to two prospective barrels. At P7 the number of TCA branches increased 10-fold in layer IV and became restricted to one barrel. In MAOA-KO mice, there was a 50\% reduction of the TCA terminal branches in layer IV, with a 40\% increase in their tangential extent. These defects were corrected in the MAOA/5-HT1B double knock-out mice, indicating an effect of the presynaptic 5-HT1B receptor on axon branching. Our results indicate that the barrel-deficient phenotype of MAOA-KO mice results from an altered refinement of the TCA arbors in their target layer IV, involving branch elaboration and collateral retraction during early postnatal life.},

abstract = { In this article, we review functional organization in sensory cortical regions—how the cortex represents the world. We consider four interrelated aspects of cortical organization: (1) the set of receptive fields of individual cortical sensory neurons, (2) how lateral interaction between cortical neurons reflects the similarity of their receptive fields, (3) the spatial distribution of receptive-field properties across the horizontal extent of the cortical tissue, and (4) how the spatial distributions of different receptive-field properties interact with one another. We show how these data are generally well explained by the theory of input-driven self-organization, with a family of computational models of cortical maps offering a parsimonious account for a wide range of map-related phenomena. We then discuss important challenges to this explanation, with respect to the maps present at birth, maps present under activity blockade, the limits of adult plasticity, and the lack of some maps in rodents. Because there is not at present another credible general theory for cortical map development, we conclude by proposing key experiments to help uncover other mechanisms that might also be operating during map development. }

abstract = {Abstract In primary sensory neocortical areas of mammals, the distribution of sensory receptors is mapped with topographic precision and amplification in proportion to the peripheral receptor density. The visual, somatosensory and auditory cortical maps are established during a critical period in development. Throughout this window in time, the developing cortical maps are vulnerable to deleterious effects of sense organ damage or sensory deprivation. The rodent barrel cortex offers an invaluable model system with which to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of topographic maps and their plasticity during development. Five rows of mystacial vibrissa (whisker) follicles on the snout and an array of sinus hairs are represented by layer IV neural modules (‘barrels’) and thalamocortical axon terminals in the primary somatosensory cortex. Perinatal damage to the whiskers or the sensory nerve innervating them irreversibly alters the structural organization of the barrels. Earlier studies emphasized the role of the sensory periphery in dictating whisker-specific brain maps and patterns. Recent advances in molecular genetics and analyses of genetically altered mice allow new insights into neural pattern formation in the neocortex and the mechanisms underlying critical period plasticity. Here, we review the development and patterning of the barrel cortex and the critical period plasticity.},

Progress on this problem will give insight into how the brain works and what can go wrong to cause developmental disorders like autism and learning disability. This paper examines the development of the outer part of the mammalian brain, the cerebral cortex. This part of the brain contains different areas with specialised functions. Over the past decade, several genes have been identified that play a major role in the development of cortical areas. During development, these genes are expressed in different patterns across the surface of the cortex. Experiments have shown that these genes interact with each other so that they each regulate how much other genes in the group are expressed. However, the experimental data are consistent with many different regulatory networks. In this study, we use a computational model to systematically screen many possible networks. This allows us to predict which regulatory interactions between these genes are important for the patterns of gene expression in the cortex to develop correctly.},

An organizer is a portion of the embryo producing signals that lead to the creation of a patterned mature structure from an embryonic primordium. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a morphogen that disperses from a rostromedial source in the neocortical primordium (NP), forms a rostral-to-caudal (R/C) gradient, and regulates embryonic and neonatal R/C patterns of gene expression in neocortex. Whether FGF8 also has organizer activity that generates the postnatal neocortical area map is uncertain. To test this possibility, new sources of FGF8 were introduced into the mouse NP with in utero microelectroporation at embryonic day 10.5, close to the estimated peak of area patterning. Results differed depending on the position of ectopic FGF8. Ectopic FGF8 in the caudalmost NP could duplicate somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary visual cortex (V1). FGF8 delivered to the midlateral NP generated a sulcus separating rostral and caudal portions of the NP, in effect creating duplicate NPs. In the caudal NP, ectopic FGF8 induced a second, inclusive area map, containing frontal cortex, S1, V1, and primary auditory areas. Moreover, duplicate S1 showed plasticity to sensory deprivation, and duplicate V1 responded to visual stimuli. Our findings implicate FGF8 as an organizer signal, and its source in the rostromedial telencephalon as an organizer of the neocortical area map.},

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is organized into subdivisions referred to as areas that are distinguished from one another by differences in architecture, axonal connections, and function. The transcription factors EMX1, EMX2, and PAX6 have been proposed to regulate arealization. Emx1 and Emx2 are expressed by progenitor cells in a low rostrolateral to high caudomedial gradient across the embryonic neocortex, and Pax6 is expressed in a high rostrolateral to low caudomedial gradient. Recent evidence has suggested that EMX2 and PAX6 have a role in the genetic regulation of arealization. Here we use a panel of seven genes (Cad6, Cad8, Id2,RZRβ, p75, EphA7, and ephrin-A5) representative of a broad range of proteins as complementary markers of positional identity to obtain a more thorough assessment of the suggested roles for EMX2 and PAX6 in arealization, and in addition to assess the proposed but untested role for EMX1 in arealization. Orderly changes in the size and positioning of domains of marker expression in Emx2 andPax6 mutants strongly imply that rostrolateral areas (motor and somatosensory) are expanded, whereas caudomedial areas (visual) are reduced in Emx2 mutants and that opposite effects occur in Pax6 mutants, consistent with their opposing gradients of expression. In contrast, patterns of marker expression, as well as the distribution of area-specific thalamocortical projections, appear normal in Emx1mutants, indicating that they do not exhibit changes in arealization. This lack of a defined role for EMX1 in arealization is supported by our finding of similar shifts in patterns of marker expression inEmx1; Emx2 double mutants as in Emx2 mutants. Thus, our findings indicate that EMX2 and PAX6 regulate, in opposing manners, arealization of the neocortex and impart positional identity to cortical cells, whereas EMX1 appears not to have a role in this process.},

Previous loss-of-function studies have indicated that Pax6 is required for normal cortical progenitor proliferation, neuronal differentiation, cortical lamination and cortical arealization, but whether and how its level of expression affects its function is unclear. We studied the developing cortex of PAX77 YAC transgenic mice carrying several copies of the human PAX6 locus with its full complement of regulatory regions. We found that PAX77 embryos express Pax6 in a normal spatial pattern, with levels up to three times higher than wild type. By crossing PAX77 mice with a new YAC transgenic line that reports Pax6 expression (DTy54), we showed that increased expression is limited by negative autoregulation. Increased expression reduces proliferation of late cortical progenitors specifically, and analysis of PAX77<->wild-type chimeras indicates that the defect is cell autonomous. We analyzed cortical arealization in PAX77 mice and found that, whereas the loss of Pax6 shifts caudal cortical areas rostrally, Pax6 overexpression at levels predicted to shift rostral areas caudally has very little effect. These findings indicate that Pax6 levels are stabilized by autoregulation, that the proliferation of cortical progenitors is sensitive to altered Pax6 levels and that cortical arealization is not.},

abstract="Telencephalic patterning centers, defined by the discrete expression domains of distinct morphogens, Fgf s in the commissural plate (CoP), Wnt s and Bmp s in the cortical hem, and a ventral domain of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are postulated to establish during development the initial patterning of the telencepahlon, including the neocortex. We show that the expression patterns of Sp5, Sp8, and Sp9, members of the Sp8-like family that are homologues of Drosophila buttonhead, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on Sp8, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of Fgf8, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used in utero electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between Sp8 and Fgf8 and their roles in cortical area patterning. We show that Fgf8 and Sp8 exhibit reciprocal induction in vivo in the embryonic telencephalon. Sp8 also induces downstream targets of Fgf8, including ETS transcription factors. In vitro assays show that Sp8 binds Fgf8 regulatory elements and is a direct transcriptional activator of Fgf8. We also show that Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is repressed by Emx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism to limit Fgf8 expression to the CoP. In vivo expression of a dominant negative Sp8 in the CoP indicates that Sp8 maintains expression of Fgf8 and also its effect on area patterning. Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of Sp8 on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of Fgf8, suggesting that in parallel to regulating Fgf8 expression, Sp8 also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning. In summary, Sp8 and Fgf8 robustly induce one another, and may act to balance the anterior-posterior area patterning of the cortex.",

We took a new approach to determine the contribution of intracortical cues. The cortical patterning molecule fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) was misexpressed in the cortical primordium to rearrange the area map. Thalamic axons faithfully tracked changes in area position and innervated duplicated somatosensory barrel fields induced by an ectopic source of FGF8, indicating that thalamic axons indeed use intracortical positional information. Because cortical layers are generated in temporal order, FGF8 misexpression at different ages could be used to shift regional identity in the subplate and cortical plate either in or out of register. Thalamic axons showed strikingly different responses in the two different conditions, disclosing sources of positional guidance in both subplate and cortical plate. Unexpectedly, axon trajectories indicated that an individual neocortical layer could provide not only laminar but also area-specific guidance. Our findings demonstrate that thalamocortical axons are directed by sequential, positional cues within the cortex and implicate FGF8 as an indirect regulator of thalamocortical innervation.},

 abstract = {We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade-speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule). As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation-not phyletic evolution-must be the dominant mode of evolution. We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation. Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start-it was never "seen" in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an "unnecessary difficulty." We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life.},

	up to several millimeters apart. In primary visual cortex (V1) of
	mammals with orientation maps, horizontal connections ramify in periodic
	patches across the cortical surface, connecting cells with similar
	orientation preferences. Rodents have orientation-selective cells
	but lack orientation maps, raising questions about relationships
	of horizontal connections to functional maps and receptive field
	properties. To address these questions, we studied anatomy of horizontal
	connections and characterized horizontal functional interactions
	in V1 of the gray squirrel, a highly visual rodent. Long-range intrinsic
	connections in squirrel V1 extended 1-2 mm but were not patchy or
	periodic. This result suggests that periodic and patchy connectivity
	is not a universal organizing principle of cortex, and the existence
	of patchy and periodic connectivity and functional maps may be linked.
	In multielectrode and intracellular recordings, we found evidence
	of unselective local interactions among cells, similar to pinwheel
	centers of carnivores. These data suggest that, in mammals with and
	without orientation maps, local connections link near neighbors without
	regard to orientation selectivity. In single-unit recordings, we
	found length-summing and end-stopped cells that were similar to those
	in other mammals. Length-summing cell surrounds were orientation
	selective, whereas surrounds of end-stopped cells were not. Receptive
	field response classes are quite similar across mammals, and therefore
	patchy and columnar connectivity may not be essential for these properties.},

  abstract = {Peripheral sensory activity follows the temporal structure of input
	signals. Central sensory processing uses also rate coding, and motor
	outputs appear to be primarily encoded by rate. I propose here a
	simple, efficient structure, converting temporal coding to rate coding
	by neuronal phase-locked loops (PLL). The simplest form of a PLL
	includes a phase detector (that is, a neuronal-plausible version
	of an ideal coincidence detector) and a controllable local oscillator
	that are connected in a negative feedback loop. The phase detector
	compares the firing times of the local oscillator and the input and
	provides an output whose firing rate is monotonically related to
	the time difference. The output rate is fed back to the local oscillator
	and forces it to phase-lock to the input. Every temporal interval
	at the input is associated with a specific pair of output rate and
	time difference values; the higher the output rate, the further the
	local oscillator is driven from its intrinsic frequency. Sequences
	of input intervals, which by definition encode input information,
	are thus represented by sequences of firing rates at the PLL's output.
	The most plausible implementation of PLL circuits is by thalamocortical
	loops in which populations of thalamic "relay" neurons function as
	phase detectors that compare the timings of cortical oscillators
	and sensory signals. The output in this case is encoded by the thalamic
	population rate. This article presents and analyzes the algorithmic
	and the implementation levels of the proposed PLL model and describes
	the implementation of the PLL model to the primate tactile system.},

  abstract = {The representation of high-frequency sensory information is a crucial
	problem faced by the nervous system. Rodent facial vibrissae constitute
	a high-resolution sensory system, capable of discriminating and detecting
	subtle changes in tactual input. During active sensing, the mechanical
	properties of vibrissae may play a key role in filtering sensory
	information and translating it into neural activity. Previous studies
	have shown that rat vibrissae resonate, conferring frequency specificity
	to trigeminal ganglion (NV) and primary somatosensory cortex (SI)
	neurons during suprathreshold sensory stimulation. In addition to
	frequency specificity, a further potential impact of vibrissa resonance
	is enhancement of sensitivity to near-threshold stimuli through signal
	amplification. To examine the effect of resonance on peri-threshold
	inputs (<or=80 microm at the vibrissa tip), we recorded NV and SI
	neurons during stimulation at multiple amplitudes and frequencies,
	and generated minimal amplitude tuning curves. Several novel findings
	emerged from this study. First, vibrissa resonance significantly
	lowered the threshold for evoked neural activity, in many cases by
	an order of magnitude compared to stimuli presented at off-resonance
	frequencies. When stimulated at the fundamental resonance frequency,
	motions as small as 8 microm at the vibrissa tip, corresponding to
	angular deflections of less than 0.2 degrees, drove neural firing
	in the periphery and cortex. Second, a closer match between vibrissal
	and neural frequency tuning was found for lower amplitude motions.
	Third, simultaneous paired recordings demonstrated that the minimal
	amplitude of resonant vibrissa stimulation required to evoke responses
	in SI increased significantly for recordings outside the primary
	vibrissa barrel column, providing additional evidence for somatotopically
	localized frequency columns. These data demonstrate that resonant
	amplification can increase the sensitivity of the vibrissa sensory

  abstract = {Rats can make extremely fine texture discriminations by "whisking"
	their vibrissa across the surface of an object. We have investigated
	one hypothesis for the neuronal basis of texture representation by
	measuring how clusters of neurons in the barrel cortex of anesthetized
	rats encode the kinetic features of sinusoidal whisker vibrations.
	Mutual information analyses of spike counts led to a number of findings.
	Information about vibration kinetics became available as early as
	6 msec after stimulus onset and reached a peak at approximately 20-30
	msec. Vibration speed, proportional to the product of vibration amplitude
	(A) and frequency (f), was the kinetic property most reliably reported
	by cortical neurons. Indeed, by measuring information when the complete
	stimulus set was collapsed into feature-defined groups, we found
	that neurons reduced the dimensionality of the stimulus from two
	features (A, f) to a single feature, the product Af. Moreover, because
	different neurons encode stimuli in the same manner, information
	loss was negligible even when the activity of separate neuronal clusters
	was pooled. This suggests a decoding scheme whereby target neurons
	could capture all available information simply by summating the signals
	from separate barrel cortex neurons. These results indicate that
	neuronal population activity provides sufficient information to allow
	nearly perfect discrimination of two vibrations, based on their deflection
	speeds, within a time scale comparable with that of a single whisking
	motion across a surface.},

	spike probabilities derived from white noise to the sequence of velocity

  abstract = {One may argue that the simplest type of neural networks beyond a single
	perceptron is an array of several perceptrons in parallel. In spite
	of their simplicity, such circuits can compute any Boolean function
	if one views the majority of the binary perceptron outputs as the
	binary output of the parallel perceptron, and they are universal
	approximators for arbitrary continuous functions with values in [0,1]
	if one views the fraction of perceptrons that output 1 as the analog
	output of the parallel perceptron. Note that in contrast to the familiar
	model of a "multi-layer perceptron" the parallel perceptron that
	we consider here has just binary values as outputs of gates on the
	hidden layer. For a long time one has thought that there exists no
	competitive learning algorithm for these extremely simple neural
	networks, which also came to be known as committee machines. It is
	commonly assumed that one has to replace the hard threshold gates
	on the hidden layer by sigmoidal gates (or RBF-gates) and that one
	has to tune the weights on at least two successive layers in order
	to achieve satisfactory learning results for any class of neural
	networks that yield universal approximators. We show that this assumption
	is not true, by exhibiting a simple learning algorithm for parallel
	perceptrons - the parallel delta rule (p-delta rule). In contrast
	to backprop for multi-layer perceptrons, the p-delta rule only has
	to tune a single layer of weights, and it does not require the computation
	and communication of analog values with high precision. Reduced communication
	also distinguishes our new learning rule from other learning rules
	for parallel perceptrons such as MADALINE. Obviously these features
	make the p-delta rule attractive as a biologically more realistic
	alternative to backprop in biological neural circuits, but also for
	implementations in special purpose hardware. We show that the p-delta
	rule also implements gradient descent-with regard to a suitable error
	measure-although it does not require to compute derivatives. Furthermore
	it is shown through experiments on common real-world benchmark datasets
	that its performance is competitive with that of other learning approaches
	from neural networks and machine learning. It has recently been shown

	We made extracellular recordings under identical conditions from
	the trigeminal ganglion, ventro-posterior medial thalamus (VPM),
	and barrel cortex while varying the direction of whisker deflection.
	We found a marked increase in the variability of single unit responses
	along the pathway. To study the consequences of this for information
	processing, we quantified the responses using mutual information.
	VPM units conveyed 48\% of the mutual information conveyed by ganglion
	units, and cortical units conveyed 12\%. The fraction of neuronal
	bandwidth used for transmitting direction information decreased from
	40\% in the ganglion to 24\% in VPM and 5\% in barrel cortex. To
	test whether, in cortex, population coding might compensate for this
	information loss, we made simultaneous recordings. We found that
	cortical neuron pairs conveyed 2.1 times the mutual information conveyed
	by single neurons. Overall, these findings indicate a marked transformation
	from a subcortical neural code based on small numbers of reliable
	neurons to a cortical code based on populations of unreliable neurons.
	However, the basic form of the neural code in ganglion, thalamus,

	To explore this, we studied the strength and short-term dynamics
	of chemical synapses interconnecting local excitatory neurons (regular-spiking,
	or RS, cells) with two types of inhibitory interneurons: fast-spiking
	(FS) cells, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) cells of layer 4 in the

	thalamocortical connections and recurrent collaterals from corticothalamic
	projection neurons of layer 6. The excitatory and inhibitory synapses
	interconnecting RS cells and FS cells were highly reliable in response
	to single stimuli and displayed strong short-term depression. In
	contrast, excitatory and inhibitory synapses interconnecting the
	RS and LTS cells were less reliable when initially activated. Excitatory
	synapses from RS cells onto LTS cells showed dramatic short-term
	facilitation, whereas inhibitory synapses made by LTS cells onto
	RS cells facilitated modestly or slightly depressed. Thalamocortical
	inputs strongly excited both RS and FS cells but rarely and only
	weakly contacted LTS cells. Both types of interneurons were strongly
	excited by facilitating synapses from axon collaterals of corticothalamic
	neurons. We conclude that there are two parallel but dynamically
	distinct systems of synaptic inhibition in layer 4 of neocortex,
	each defined by its intrinsic spiking properties, the short-term
	plasticity of its chemical synapses, and (as shown previously) an
	exclusive set of electrical synapses. Because of their unique dynamic
	properties, each inhibitory network will be recruited by different

	representation of the whiskers (the barrel cortex) which has been
	produced by trimming all whiskers on one side of the snout except
	two. This manipulation alters the pattern of afferent sensory activity
	while avoiding any direct nerve damage. Our simplified model circuitry
	represents multiple cortical layers and inhibitory neurons within
	each layer of a barrel-column. Utilizing a computational model we
	show that the evolution of the response bias in the barrel-column
	towards spared whiskers is consistent with synaptic modifications
	that follow the rules of the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM)
	theory. The BCM theory postulates that a neuron possesses a dynamic
	synaptic modification threshold, thetaM, which dictates whether the
	neuron's activity at any given instant will lead to strengthening
	or weakening of the synapses impinging on it. However, the major
	prediction of our model is the explanation of the delay in response
	potentiation in the layer-IV neurons through a masking effect produced
	by the thresholded monotonically increasing inhibition expressed
	by either the logarithmic function, h(x) = mu log(1 + x), or by the
	power function, h(x) = mu x(0.8-0.9), where mu is a constant. Furthermore,
	simulated removal of the supragranular layers (layers II/III) reduces
	plasticity of neurons in the remaining layers (IV-VI) and points
	to the role of noise in synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Rats use active, rhythmic movements of their whiskers to acquire tactile
	information about three-dimensional object features. There are no
	receptors along the length of the whisker; therefore all tactile
	information must be mechanically transduced back to receptors at
	the whisker base. This raises the question: how might the rat determine
	the radial contact position of an object along the whisker? We developed
	two complementary biomechanical models that show that the rat could
	determine radial object distance by monitoring the rate of change
	of moment (or equivalently, the rate of change of curvature) at the
	whisker base. The first model is used to explore the effects of taper
	and inherent whisker curvature on whisker deformation and used to
	predict the shapes of real rat whiskers during deflections at different
	radial distances. Predicted shapes closely matched experimental measurements.
	The second model describes the relationship between radial object
	distance and the rate of change of moment at the base of a tapered,
	inherently curved whisker. Together, these models can account for
	recent recordings showing that some trigeminal ganglion (Vg) neurons
	encode closer radial distances with increased firing rates. The models
	also suggest that four and only four physical variables at the whisker
	base -- angular position, angular velocity, moment, and rate of change
	of moment -- are needed to describe the dynamic state of a whisker.
	We interpret these results in the context of our evolving hypothesis
	that neural responses in Vg can be represented using a state-encoding
	scheme that includes combinations of these four variables.},

	in patches, 0.5-1.0 mm across, where orientation selectivities are
	high, and where preferred orientations rotate linearly along one
	axis while remaining constant along the other. Most of these linear
	zones lie between the centers of adjacent ocular dominance columns,
	with their short iso-orientation slabs oriented perpendicular, in
	regions enjoying the greatest binocular overlap. These two-dimensional
	linear zones are segregated by one- and zero-dimensional discontinuities
	that are particularly abundant in the centers of ocular dominance
	columns, and that are also correlated with cytochrome oxidase-rich
	zones within them. Discontinuities smaller than 90 degrees extend
	in one dimension, as fractures, while discontinuities greater than
	90 degrees are confined to points, in the form of singularities,
	that are generated when orientation preferences rotate continuously
	through +/- 180 degrees along circular paths. The continuous rotations
	through 180 degrees imply that direction preferences are not organized
	laterally in striate cortex. And they also ensure that preferences
	for all orientations converge at each singularity, with perpendicular
	orientations represented uniquely close together on opposite sides.
	The periodic interspersing of linear zones and singularities suggests
	that orientation preferences are organized by at least two competing
	schemes. They are optimized for linearity, along with selectivity
	and binocularity, in the linear zones, and they are optimized for
	density near singularities. Since upper-layer neurons are likely
	to have similarly sized dendritic fields in all regions (Lund and
	Yoshioka, 1991), those in the linear zones should receive precise
	information about narrowly constrained orientations, while those
	near singularities should receive coarse information about all orientations--very
	different inputs that suggest different perceptual functions.},

	respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not

	the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the

	specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled
	axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons,
	along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the
	preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 microm,
	the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found
	along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred

	mystacial pad. The latter was invariably comprised of whiskers aligned
	in regular rows. In each row, whiskers were oriented perpendicular
	to the animal's rostrocaudal axis; all shared a specific dorsoventral
	orientation. In all species, progressing from rostral to caudal in
	any vibrissal row, there was a precisely exponential increase in
	whisker length. Each whisker appeared to act as a lever-like transducer,
	providing information as to whether or not--but not where--an individual
	vibrissa had been deflected. The rat's frontal microvibrissae system

	medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus in urethane-anaesthetised young
	(postnatal day 16-24) rats. Receptive fields (RFs) on the whisker
	pad were mapped for 31 neurones, and 10 cells were recovered for
	morphological reconstruction of their dendritic arbors. Most VPM
	neurones had antagonistic subthreshold RFs that could be divided
	into excitatory and inhibitory whiskers. VPM cells comprised different
	classes, the most frequently occurring being single-whisker excitation
	(SWE) and multi-whisker excitation (MWE) cells. In SWE cells (36
	\% of VPM neurones), only principal whisker (PW) deflection evoked
	an EPSP and was followed by a single action potential (AP) or remained
	subthreshold. The depolarisation was terminated by a large, delayed
	IPSP. A stimulus evoked on average 0.74 +/- 0.46 APs (mean +/- S.D.)
	with short latency (8.1 +/- 1.0 ms) and small temporal scatter (0.31
	+/- 0.23 ms dispersion of 50 \% of the first APs). In MWE cells (29
	\% of VPM neurones), deflection of several whiskers evoked EPSPs.
	PW responses were either subthreshold EPSPs or consisted of an EPSP
	followed by one or several APs (0.96 +/- 0.99 APs per stimulus).
	AP responses were often associated with putative low-threshold calcium-dependent
	regenerative potentials and were followed by a small delayed IPSP.
	AP responses had a longer latency (12.3 +/- 2.6 ms) and larger temporal
	scatter (2.5 +/- 1.6 ms) than responses of SWE cells. MWE cells had
	a lower input resistance than SWE cells. The elongation of dendritic
	arbors along the representation fields of rows and arcs in VPM barreloids
	was weakly correlated with the subthreshold RF elongation along whisker
	rows and arcs, respectively. Evoked EPSP-AP responses exhibited a
	sharper directional tuning than subthreshold EPSPs, which in turn
	exhibited a sharper directional tuning than IPSPs. In conclusion,
	we document two main classes of VPM neurones. SWE cells responded
	with a precisely timed single AP to the deflection of the PW. In

  abstract = {1. Extracellular single-unit recordings and controlled whisker stimuli
	were used to compare response properties of cells in the barreloids
	of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus and the barrels
	in the rat primary somatosensory cortex. Whiskers were deflected
	alone or in combinations involving up to four immediately adjacent
	whiskers to assess their relative inhibitory and excitatory contributions
	to individual receptive fields. Quantitative data were obtained from
	51 thalamocortical units (TCUs), 79 ``regular-spiking'' barrel neurons
	(RSUs), and 5 ``fast-spiking'' barrel neurons (FSUs) in 28 normal
	female adult rats. 2. A random-noise generator was used to produce
	small, continuously varying whisker movements that were applied to
	one to four adjacent whiskers while the principal (columnar) whisker
	was displaced with the use of a ramp-and-hold deflection. RSUs displayed
	adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition that increased as the number of
	adjacent whiskers stimulated was incremented. Asymptotic levels of
	inhibition were reached with the application of the noise stimulus
	to two or three adjacent whiskers depending on which particular combinations
	were deflected. By contrast, TCUs and FSUs showed weak, or no, surround
	inhibition. 3. As the number of adjacent whiskers stimulated increased,
	the background (prestimulus) activity in TCUs and FSUs increased,
	whereas displayed background activity in RSUs was relatively unaffected.
	The increase in background activity observed in the FSUs is hypothesized
	to mediate adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition in the RSUs. 4. A spatial
	gradient of adjacent whisker inhibition was observed in RSUs. The
	caudally adjacent whisker evoked more inhibition than the rostrally
	adjacent whisker, and the ventral more than the dorsal. A cortical
	origin for the gradient is suggested by the finding that TCUs did
	not show a spatial inhibitory gradient. 5. As the noise stimulus
	was applied to an increasing number of adjacent whiskers, RSUs became
	more sharply tuned for deflection angles. Neither TCUs nor FSUs showed
	increases in angular tuning. 6. Inhibition worked disproportionately
	in RSUs to inhibit those responses that were initially the least
	robust. For example, inhibition was most effective at reducing responses
	to nonpreferred versus preferred whisker deflection angles. 7. To
	assess the principal whisker's effect on adjacent whisker excitatory
	responses, the noise stimulus was applied to the principal whisker.
	In RSUs, principal whisker-evoked inhibition was more potent than
	adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition. FSUs were excited to a greater
	extent by the application of the noise stimulus to the principal
	whisker than to adjacent whiskers. TCUs did not display principal
	whisker-evoked inhibition. 8. Inhibition within the barrel serves
	as a contrast enhancement mechanism to differentiate small versus
	large magnitude responses. Less vigorous responses, such as those
	associated with perturbations of noncolumnar whiskers and inputs
	from nonoptimal deflection angles, are more strongly suppressed.
	During active touch, when many whiskers simultaneously palpate an
	object, these inhibitory interactions could effectively increase
	the ``principal whiskerness'' of the cortical column.},

	pyramidal neurons filled in vivo in developing barrel cortex of control

	Whisker trimming over approximately 2 weeks markedly reduced overall

	were as likely to innervate deprived areas as spared ones. The largest
	effect of deprivation was instead to reduce the length of those axonal
	branches in L2/3 oriented toward deprived regions. Thus, the location
	of a branch relative to its originating soma, rather than its own
	location within any specific cortical column, was the strongest determinant
	of axonal organization. Individual axons from L2/3 into L5/6 were
	similarly altered by whisker trimming although to a lesser extent.
	Thus, sensory experience over relatively short timescales may change
	the patterning of specific axonal branches within as well as between

	Therefore, a balance between local excitation and surround inhibition
	is required. Here we explore the spatiotemporal aspects of cortical
	depolarization and hyperpolarization of rats anesthetized with urethane.
	New voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) were used for high-resolution real-time
	visualization of the cortical responses to whisker deflections and
	cutaneous stimulations of the whisker pad. These advances facilitated
	imaging of ongoing activity and evoked responses even without signal
	averaging. We found that the motion of a single whisker evoked a
	cortical response exhibiting either one or three phases. During a
	triphasic response, there was first a cortical depolarization in
	a small cortical region the size of a single cortical barrel. Subsequently,
	this depolarization increased and spread laterally in an oval manner,
	preferentially along rows of the barrel field. During the second
	phase, the amplitude of the evoked response declined rapidly, presumably
	because of recurrent inhibition. Subsequently, the third phase exhibiting
	a depolarization rebound was observed and clear, and approximately
	16 Hz oscillations were detected. Stimulus conditions revealing a
	net surround hyperpolarization during the second phase were also
	found. By using new, improved VSD, the present findings shed new

  abstract = {Rats rhythmically sweep their whiskers over object features, generating
	sequential deflections of whisker arcs. Such moving wavefronts of
	whisker deflection are likely to be fundamental elements of natural
	somatosensory input. To determine how moving wavefronts are represented
	in somatosensory cortex (S1), we measured single- and multiunit neural
	responses in S1 of anesthetized rats to moving wavefronts applied
	through a piezoelectric whisker deflector array. Wavefronts consisted
	of sequential deflections of individual whisker arcs, which moved
	progressively across the whisker array. Starting position (starting
	arc), direction, and velocity of wavefronts were varied. Neurons
	responded strongly only when wavefront starting position included
	their principal whisker (PW). When wavefronts started at neighboring
	positions and swept through the PW, responses to the PW arc were
	suppressed by <or=95\%, and responses over the entire wavefront duration
	were suppressed by <or=60\% compared with wavefronts that initiated
	with the PW. Suppression occurred with interarc deflection delays
	of >or=5 ms, was maximal at 20 ms, and recovered within 100-200 ms.
	Suppression of PW arc responses during wavefronts was largely independent
	of wavefront direction. However, layer 2/3 neurons showed direction
	selectivity for responses to the entire wavefront (the entire sequence
	of SW and PW arc deflection). Wavefront direction selectivity was
	correlated with receptive field somatotopy and reflected differential
	responses to the specific SWs that were deflected first in a wavefront.
	These results indicate that suppressive interwhisker interactions
	shape responses to wavefronts, resulting in increased salience of
	wavefront starting position, and, in some neurons, preference for
	wavefront direction.},

	endings at the level of the ring sinus, 4) longitudinally oriented
	lanceolate endings, 5) club-like ringwulst endings, 6) reticular
	endings, 7) spiny endings, and 8) encapsulated endings. Of particular
	contrast, each nerve fiber that innervates Merkel cells at the level
	of the ring sinus in the rat usually terminates as a single, relatively
	small cluster of endings, whereas in the cat they terminate en passant
	as several large clusters of endings. Also, individual arbors of

	as part of a rapid sequence often differ from responses to an isolated
	stimulus. It has been reported that sequential stimulation of two
	whiskers produces facilitatory modulations of barrel cortex neuronal
	responses. These results are at odds with the well-known suppressive
	interaction that has been usually described. Herein, we have examined
	the dependency of response modulation on the spatiotemporal pattern
	of stimulation by varying the spatial arrangement of the deflected
	vibrissae, the temporal frequency of stimulation, and the time interval
	between whisker deflections. Extracellular recordings were made from
	primary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats. Two contralateral
	whiskers were stimulated at 0.5 and 8 Hz at intervals ranging from
	0 to +/-30 ms. Response interactions were assessed during stimulation
	of the principal and adjacent whiskers, first from the same row and
	second from the same arc. When tested at 0.5 Hz, 59\% of single units
	showed a statistically significant suppressive interaction, whereas
	response facilitation was found in only 6\% of cells. In contrast,
	at 8 Hz, a significant supralinear summation was observed in 19\%
	of the cells, particularly for stimulations along an arc rather than
	along a row. Multi-unit recordings showed similar results. These
	observations indicate that most of the interactions in the barrel
	cortex during two-whisker stimulation are suppressive. However, facilitation
	can be revealed when stimuli are applied at a physiological frequency

	we demonstrate that similar patterns can be simulated by means of
	local growth-promoting and growth-retarding interactions within the
	circular domains of single barrels. The model correctly predicts
	that larger barrels contain more spatially complex subbarrel patterns,
	suggesting that the development of barrels and of the patterns within
	them may be understood in terms of some relatively simple dynamic
	processes. We also simulate the full nonlinear equations to demonstrate
	the predictive value of our linear analysis. Finally, we show that
	the pattern formation is robust with respect to the geometry of the
	barrel by simulating patterns on a realistically shaped barrel domain.
	This work shows how simple pattern forming mechanisms can explain

	reproduced by "dimension-reduction" computational models, suggesting
	that the principles of continuity and coverage may underlie cortical
	map organization. However, the mechanisms responsible for establishing

	feature map during development causes a coordinated reorganization
	of the remaining maps or whether the remaining maps are unaffected.
	We removed the ocular dominance map by monocular enucleation in newborn
	ferrets, so that single eye stimulation drove the cortex in a more
	spatially uniform manner in adult monocular animals compared with
	normal animals. Maps of orientation, spatial frequency, and retinotopy
	formed in monocular ferrets, but their structures and spatial relationships
	differed from those in normal ferrets. The wavelength of the orientation
	map increased, so that the average orientation gradient across the
	cortex decreased. The decrease in the orientation gradient in monocular
	animals was most prominent in the high gradient regions of the spatial
	frequency map, indicating a coordinated reorganization between these
	two maps. In monocular animals, the orthogonal relationship between
	the orientation and spatial frequency maps was preserved, and the
	orthogonal relationship between the orientation and retinotopic maps
	became more pronounced. These results were consistent with detailed
	predictions of a dimension-reduction model of cortical organization.
	Thus, the number of feature maps in a cortical area influences the
	relationships between them, and inputs to the cortex have a significant
	role in generating these relationships.},

	the same layer 4 barrel ('barrel-related') were investigated using
	dual whole-cell voltage recordings in acute slices of rat somatosensory
	cortex. Recordings were followed by reconstructions of biocytin-filled
	neurones. The onset latency of unitary EPSPs was 1.1 +/- 0.4 ms,
	the 20-80\% rise time was 0.7 +/- 0.2 ms, the average amplitude was
	1.0 +/- 0.7 mV and the decay time constant was 15.7 +/- 4.5 ms. The
	coefficient of variation (c.v.) of unitary EPSP amplitudes decreased
	with increasing EPSP peak and was 0.33 +/- 0.18. Bursts of APs in
	the presynaptic pyramidal cell resulted in EPSPs that, over a wide
	range of frequencies (5-100 Hz), displayed amplitude depression.
	Anatomically the barrel-related pyramidal cells in the lower half
	of layer 2/3 have a long apical dendrite with a small terminal tuft,
	while pyramidal cells in the upper half of layer 2/3 have shorter
	and often more 'irregularly' shaped apical dendrites that branch
	profusely in layer 1. The number of putative excitatory synaptic
	contacts established by the axonal collaterals of a L2/3 pyramidal
	cell with a postsynaptic pyramidal cell in the same column varied
	between 2 and 4, with an average of 2.8 +/- 0.7 (n = 8 pairs). Synaptic
	contacts were established predominantly on the basal dendrites at
	a mean geometric distance of 91 +/- 47 mum from the pyramidal cell
	soma. L2/3-to-L2/3 connections formed a blob-like innervation domain
	containing 2.8 mm of the presynaptic axon collaterals with a bouton
	density of 0.3 boutons per mum axon. Within the supragranular layers
	of its home column a single L2/3 pyramidal cell established about
	900 boutons suggesting that 270 pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 are
	innervated by an individual pyramidal cell. In turn, a single pyramidal
	cell received synaptic inputs from 270 other L2/3 pyramidal cells.
	The innervation domain of L2/3-to-L2/3 connections superimposes almost
	exactly with that of L4-to-L2/3 connections. This suggests that synchronous
	feed-forward excitation of L2/3 pyramidal cells arriving from layer
	4 could be potentially amplified in layer 2/3 by feedback excitation
	within a column and then relayed to the neighbouring columns.},

	neurone evoked single unitary EPSPs in the L2/3 pyramidal cell with
	a peak amplitude of 0.7 +/- 0.6 mV. The average latency was 2.1 +/-
	0.6 ms, the rise time was 0.8 +/- 0.3 ms and the decay time constant
	was 12.7 +/- 3.5 ms. The percentage of failures of an AP in a L4

	was 4.9 +/- 8.8 \% and the coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the
	unitary EPSP amplitude was 0.27 +/- 0.13. Both c.v. and percentage

	glutamate receptors (GluRs) in L2/3 pyramidal cells were of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
	(NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) and the non-NMDAR type. At -60 mV in the
	presence of extracellular Mg2+ (1 mM), 29 +/- 15 \% of the EPSP voltage-time
	integral was blocked by NMDAR antagonists. In 0 Mg2+, the NMDAR/AMPAR
	ratio of the EPSC was 0.50 +/- 0.29, about half the value obtained
	for L4 spiny neurone connections. Burst stimulation of L4 spiny neurones
	showed that EPSPs in L2/3 pyramidal cells depressed over a wide range
	of frequencies (1-100 s(-1) ). However, at higher frequencies (30
	s(-1)) EPSP summation overcame synaptic depression so that the summed
	EPSP was larger than the first EPSP amplitude in the train. The number
	of putative synaptic contacts established by the axonal collaterals
	of the L4 projection neurone with the target neurone in layer 2/3
	varied between 4 and 5, with an average of 4.5 +/- 0.5 (n = 13 pairs).
	Synapses were established on basal dendrites of the pyramidal cell.
	Their mean geometric distance from the pyramidal cell soma was 67
	+/- 34 microm (range, 16-196 microm). The results suggest that each
	connected L4 spiny neurone produces a weak but reliable EPSP in the
	pyramidal cell. Therefore transmission of signals to layer 2/3 is
	likely to have a high threshold requiring simultaneous activation
	of many L4 neurons, implying that L4 spiny neurone to L2/3 pyramidal
	cell synapses act as a gate for the lateral spread of excitation
	in layer 2/3.},

	the azimuthal position of sounds. The dominant models for processing
	ITDs are based on the Jeffress model and predict neurons that fire
	maximally at a common ITD across their responsive frequency range.
	Such neurons are indeed found in the binaural pathways and are referred
	to as "peak-type." However, other neurons discharge minimally at
	a common ITD (trough-type), and others do not display a common ITD
	at the maxima or minima (intermediate-type). From recordings of neurons
	in the auditory cortex of the unanesthetized rabbit to low-frequency
	tones and envelopes of high-frequency sounds, we show that the different
	response types combine to form a continuous axis of best ITD. This
	axis extends to ITDs well beyond that allowed by the head width.
	In Jeffress-type models, sensitivity to large ITDs would require
	neural delay lines with large differences in path lengths between
	the two ears. Our results suggest instead that sensitivity to large
	ITDs is created with short delay lines, using neurons that display
	intermediate- and trough-type responses. We demonstrate that a neuron's
	best ITD can be predicted from (1) its characteristic delay, a rough
	measure of the delay line, (2) its characteristic phase, which defines
	the response type, and (3) its best frequency for ITD sensitivity.
	The intermediate- and trough-type neurons that have large best ITDs
	are predicted to be most active when sounds at the two ears are decorrelated
	and may transmit information about auditory space other than sound
	localization.},

	their sensitivity to the direction in which the vibrissae move. Directional
	sensitivity is also well conserved in brainstem, thalamic, and cortical
	neurons of the lemniscal pathway, indicating that this property plays
	a key role in the organization of the vibrissal system. Here, we
	show that directional tuning is also a fundamental feature of second-order
	interpolaris neurons that give rise to the paralemniscal pathway.
	Quantitative assessment of responses to vibrissa deflection revealed
	an anisotropic organization of receptive fields with regard to topography,
	response magnitude, and the degree of angular tuning. Responses evoked
	by all vibrissae within the receptive field of each cell exhibited
	a high consistency of direction preference, but a striking difference
	in angular tuning preference was found among cells that reside in
	the rostral and caudal divisions of the interpolaris nucleus. Although
	in caudal interpolaris vectors of angular preference pointed in all
	directions, in rostral interpolaris virtually all vectors pointed
	upward, revealing a strong preference for this direction. Control
	experiments showed that the upward bias did not rely on a preferential
	innervation of rostral cells by upwardly tuned primary vibrissa afferents,
	nor did it rely on a direction-selective recruitment of feedforward
	inhibition. We thus propose that the upward preference bias of rostral
	cells, which project to the posterior group of the thalamus, emerges
	from use-dependent synaptic processes that relate to the kinematics

	during tactile exploration. The intentional sampling of signals in
	this frequency range suggests that neural processing of tactile information
	may be differentially engaged in this bandwidth. We examined action
	potential responses in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) to a
	range of frequencies of vibrissa motion. Single vibrissae were mechanically
	deflected with 5-s pulse trains at rates </=40 Hz. As previously
	reported, vibrissa deflection evoked robust neural responses that
	consistently adapted to stimulus rates >/=3 Hz. In contrast with
	this low-pass feature of the response, several other characteristics
	of the response revealed bandpass response properties. While average
	evoked response amplitudes measured 0-35 ms after stimulus onset
	typically decreased with increasing frequency, the later components
	of the response (>15 ms post stimulus) were augmented at frequencies
	between 3 and 10 Hz. Further, during the steady state, both rate
	and temporal measures of neural activity, measured as total spike
	rate or vector strength (a measure of temporal fidelity of spike
	timing across cycles), showed peak signal values at 5-10 Hz. A minimal
	biophysical network model of SI layer IV, consisting of an excitatory
	and inhibitory neuron and thalamocortical input, captured the spike
	rate and vector strength band-pass characteristics. Further analyses
	in which specific elements were selectively removed from the model
	suggest that slow inhibitory influences give rise to the band-pass
	peak in temporal precision, while thalamocortical adaptation can
	account for the band-pass peak in spike rate. The presence of these
	band-pass characteristics may be a general property of thalamocortical
	circuits that lead rodents to target this frequency range with their
	whisking behavior.},

  abstract = {Animals in their natural environments actively process spatiotemporally
	complex sensory signals in order to guide adaptive behavior. It therefore
	seems likely that the properties of both single neurons and neural
	ensembles should reflect the dynamic nature of such interactions.
	During exploratory behaviors, rats move their whiskers to actively
	discriminate between different tactile features. We investigated
	whether this dynamic sensory processing was reflected in the spatial
	and temporal properties of neurons in layer V of the 'whisker area'
	in the rat primary somatosensory cortex. We found that the majority
	of layer V neurons had large (8.5+/-4.9 whiskers) spatiotemporal
	receptive fields (i.e. individual cells responded best to different
	whiskers as a function of post-stimulus time), and that the excitatory
	responses of surround whiskers formed a spatial gradient of excitation
	that seemed to reflect the greater use of the ventral and caudal
	whiskers during natural behaviors. Analyses of ensembles of layer
	V neurons revealed that single-whisker stimuli activated a portion
	of layer V that extends well beyond a single cortical column (average
	of 5.6 barrel cortical columns). Based on these results, we conclude
	that the rat primary somatosensory cortex does not appear to operate
	as a static decoder of tactile information. On the contrary, our
	data suggest that tactile processing in rats is likely to involve
	the on-going interactions between populations of broadly tuned neurons
	in the thalamocortical pathway.},

	found that individual neurons in the cat primary visual cortex can
	communicate over suprisingly long distances horizontally (up to 4
	mm), in directions parallel to the cortical surface. For all of the
	cells having widespread projections, the collaterals within their
	axonal fields were distributed in repeating clusters, with an average
	periodicity of 1 mm. This pattern of extensive clustered projections
	has been revealed by combining the techniques of intracellular recording
	and injection of horseradish peroxidase with three-dimensional computer
	graphic reconstructions. The clustering pattern was most apparent
	when the cells were rotated to present a view parallel to the cortical
	surface. The pattern was observed in more than half of the pyramidal
	and spiny stellate cells in the cortex and was seen in all cortical
	layers. In our sample, cells made distant connections within their
	own layer and/or within another layer. The axon of one cell had clusters
	covering the same area in two layers, and the clusters in the deeper
	layer were located under those in the upper layer, suggesting a relationship
	between the clustering phenomenon and columnar cortical architecture.
	Some pyramidal cells did not project into the white matter, forming
	intrinsic connections exclusively. Finally, the axonal fields of
	all our injected cells were asymmetric, extending for greater distances
	along one cortical axis than along the orthogonal axis. The axons
	appeared to cover areas of cortex representing a larger part of the
	visual field than that covered by the excitatory portion of the cell's

  abstract = {A temporal sensory code occurs in posterior medial (POm) thalamus
	of the rat vibrissa system, where the latency for the spike rate
	to peak is observed to increase with increasing frequency of stimulation
	between 2 and 11 Hz. In contrast, the latency of the spike rate in
	the ventroposterior medial (VPm) thalamus is constant in this frequency
	range. We consider the hypothesis that two factors are essential
	for latency coding in the POm. The first is GABAB-mediated feedback
	inhibition from the reticular thalamic (Rt) nucleus, which provides
	delayed and prolonged input to thalamic structures. The second is
	sensory input that leads to an accelerating spike rate in brain stem
	nuclei. Essential aspects of the experimental observations are replicated
	by the analytical solution of a rate-based model with a minimal architecture
	that includes only the POm and Rt nuclei, i.e., an increase in stimulus
	frequency will increase the level of inhibitory output from Rt thalamus
	and lead to a longer latency in the activation of POm thalamus. This
	architecture, however, admits period-doubling at high levels of GABAB-mediated
	conductance. A full architecture that incorporates the VPm nucleus
	suppresses period-doubling. A clear match between the experimentally
	measured spike rates and the numerically calculated rates for the
	full model occurs when VPm thalamus receives stronger brain stem
	input and weaker GABAB-mediated inhibition than POm thalamus. Our
	analysis leads to the prediction that the latency code will disappear
	if GABAB-mediated transmission is blocked in POm thalamus or if the
	onset of sensory input is too abrupt. We suggest that GABAB-mediated
	inhibition is a substrate of temporal coding in normal brain function.},

	The current study used high-speed video analysis to investigate whisker
	movements in untrained, freely moving rats encountering unexpected,
	vertical surfaces. A prominent feature of rat vibrissal movement
	is the repeated posterior-anterior sweep of the whiskers in which
	the macrovibrissae are seen to move largely in synchrony. Here we
	show that a second significant component of whisking behavior is
	the size of the arc, or "spread," between the whiskers. Observed
	spread is shown to vary over the whisk cycle and to substantially
	decrease during exploration of an unexpected surface. We further
	show that the timing of whisker movements is affected by surface
	contact such that 1) the whiskers rapidly cease forward protraction
	following an initial, unexpected contact, and may do so even more
	rapidly following contact with the same surface in the subsequent
	whisk cycle, and 2) retraction velocity is reduced following this
	latter contact, leading to longer second-contact durations. This
	evidence is taken to support two hypotheses: 1) that the relative
	velocities of different whiskers may be actively controlled by the
	rat and 2) that control of whisker velocity and timing may serve
	to increase the number and duration of whisker-surface contacts while
	ensuring that such contacts are made with a light touch.},

	for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics. Even
	the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed
	by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately (hydrodynamic trail
	following). While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals
	at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps
	its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular
	to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals
	possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of
	which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure
	effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces
	the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of
	vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force
	measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find

  abstract = {The thalamic reticular nucleus (Rt) is strategically positioned to
	integrate descending and ascending signals in the control of sensorimotor
	and other thalamocortical activity. Its prominent role in the generation
	of sleep spindles notwithstanding, relatively little is known of
	Rt function in regulating interactions with the sensory environment.
	We recorded and compared the responses of individual Rt and thalamocortical
	neurons in the ventroposterior medial (VPm) nucleus of the rat to
	controlled deflections of mystacial vibrissae. Transient Rt responses
	to the onset (ON) and offset (OFF) of vibrissa deflection are larger
	and longer in duration than those of VPm and of all other populations
	studied in the whisker/barrel pathway. Magnitudes of ON and OFF responses
	in Rt were negatively correlated with immediately preceding activities,
	suggesting a contribution of low-threshold T-type Ca(2+) channels.
	Rt neurons also respond with high tonic firing rates during sustained
	vibrissa deflections. By comparison, VPm neurons are less likely
	to respond tonically and are more likely to exhibit tonic suppression.
	Rt and VPm populations are similar to each other, however, in that
	they retain properties of directional sensitivity established in
	primary afferent neurons. In both populations neurons are selective
	for deflection angle and exhibit directional consistency, responding
	best to a particular direction of movement regardless of the starting
	position of the vibrissal hair. These findings suggest a role for
	Rt in the processing of detailed sensory information. Temporally,
	Rt may function to limit the duration of stimulus-evoked VPm responses
	and to focus them on rapid vibrissa perturbations. Moreover, by regulating
	the baseline activity of VPm neurons, Rt may indirectly enhance the
	response selectivity of layer IV barrel neurons to synchronous VPm
	firing.},

	stimuli are represented over wide cortical areas and single cells

	sensory inputs, we made intracellular recordings from the barrel
	cortex of anesthetized rats in vivo. For each cell, we deflected
	the principal whisker (PW) either alone or preceded by the deflection
	of a single adjacent whisker (AW) at an interval of 20 or 3 ms. At
	the 20-ms interval in all cases, prior AW deflection significantly
	suppressed the PW-evoked spike output and caused the underlying synaptic
	response to reach a peak Vm less depolarized than that arising from
	PW deflection alone. The decrease in peak Vm was not attributed to
	hyperpolarizing inhibition but to a divisive reduction in PW-evoked
	PSP amplitude. The reduction in amplitude was not a result of shunting
	inhibition but was mostly a result of removal of the synaptic drive,
	or disfacilitation. When the AW-PW interval was shortened to 3 ms,
	spike suppression was observed in a subset of the cells studied.
	In most cases, a divisive reduction in synaptic response amplitude
	was offset by summation with the preceding AW-evoked depolarization.
	To determine whether suppression is a general feature of synaptic
	integration by barrel cortex neurons, we also characterized the interaction
	of responses evoked by local electrical stimulation. In contrast
	to the whisker data, we found that responses to paired stimulation
	at the same intervals produced more spikes and reached a peak Vm
	more depolarized than the individual responses alone, suggesting
	that whisker-evoked suppression is not a result of postsynaptic mechanisms.
	Instead, we propose that cross-whisker response suppression depends

	the cell was not caused by hyperpolarization (subtractive inhibition)

  abstract = {The organization of primary visual cortex has been heavily studied
	for nearly 50 years, and in the last 20 years functional imaging
	has provided high-resolution maps of its tangential organization.
	Recently, however, the usefulness of maps like those of orientation
	and spatial frequency (SF) preference has been called into question
	because they do not, by themselves, predict how moving images are
	represented in V1. In this review, we discuss a model for cortical
	responses (the spatiotemporal filtering model) that specifies the
	types of cortical maps needed to predict distributed activity within
	V1. We then review the structure and interrelationships of several
	of these maps, including those of orientation, SF, and temporal frequency
	preference. Finally, we discuss tests of the model and the sufficiency
	of the requisite maps in predicting distributed cortical responses.
	Although the spatiotemporal filtering model does not account for
	all responses within V1, it does, with reasonable accuracy, predict
	population responses to a variety of complex stimuli.},

	neurone in an incubation solution which contained, in addition to
	DAB, cytochrome C for cytochrome oxidase (CO) reaction of the barrels.
	2. Recording and intracellular staining were made in layer 5b under
	urethane anaesthesia. CO-stained barrels were observed in layer 4.
	Physiologically and morphologically characterized neurones were mostly
	large pyramidal neurones that responded to more than one whisker
	and displayed transient-type responses. 3. In tangential sections,
	the apical dendrite of the HRP-filled neurone was followed from the
	soma level upward as it ascended through the barrelfield in layer
	4. The cross-section of the apical dendrite was found in the periphery
	of the CO-stained barrel. Using the apical dendrite as a guide, the
	basal dendritic field of the layer 5b pyramidal neurone was aligned
	on the pattern of layer 4 barrels. The soma was seen to project basal
	dendrites in all directions, involving one or two neighbouring barrels/columns.
	4. In sixteen neurones examined in tangential sections, a complete
	spatial tuning map constructed by measuring sensitivity of the neurone
	to different whiskers could be compared to the basal dendritic field
	in relation to the pattern of overlying layer 4 barrels. The mean

	Neuronal pairs showed correlations in both spontaneous and sensory-evoked

	decreased with increasing distance between neurons and, for neuronal
	pairs the same distance apart, with distance of the pair from the

	major input source, thalamic barreloid neurons. In both barrel regular-spike
	units (RSUs) and fast-spike units (FSUs), presumed excitatory and

	test deflections in a largely angularly nonspecific manner, that
	is, adaptation in one direction reduced responses for test deflections

	so after adaptation. In adapted RSUs, responses to suboptimal directions
	were suppressed most and angular preferences remained constant; tuning
	therefore became sharper. Adaptation effects in RSUs and FSUs do
	not appear to reflect corresponding changes in thalamic neurons.
	The angularly nonspecific suppression of barrel neurons is likely
	mediated by local intrabarrel suppressive interactions, such as broadly

	In the case of regular-spiking units, i.e., putative excitatory cells,
	direction preferences were quite similar between responses to single-whisker
	stimulation of the principal and adjacent whiskers. In multi-whisker
	stimulation at short (< or = 5 ms) interstimulus intervals (ISIs),

	stimulation. These results suggest that there are neuronal networks

	direction preference that could be the neuronal basis of the direction-selective
	facilitation of the response to multi-whisker stimulation. In contrast,
	multi-whisker stimulation at long (> or = 6 ms) ISIs caused non-direction-selective
	suppression of the response to the second stimulus. In the case of
	fast-spiking units, i.e., putative inhibitory cells, poor direction

  abstract = {Thalamocortical afferents innervate both excitatory and inhibitory
	cells, the latter in turn producing disynaptic feedforward inhibition,
	thus creating fast excitation-inhibition sequences in the cortical
	cells. Since this inhibition is disynaptic, the time lag of the excitation-inhibition
	sequence could be approximately 2-3 ms, while it is often as short
	as only slightly above 1 ms; the mechanism and function of such fast
	IPSPs are not fully understood. Here we show that thalamic activation
	of inhibitory neurons precedes that of excitatory neurons, due to
	increased conduction velocity of thalamic axons innervating inhibitory
	cells. Developmentally, such latency differences were seen only after
	the end of the second postnatal week, prior to the completion of
	myelination of the thalamocortical afferent. Furthermore, destroying
	myelination failed to extinguish the latency difference. Instead,
	axons innervating inhibitory cells had consistently lower threshold,
	indicating they had larger diameter, which is likely to underlie
	the differential conduction velocity. Since faster activation of
	GABAergic neurons from the thalamus can not only curtail monosynaptic
	EPSPs but also make disynaptic ISPSs precede disynaptic EPSPs, such
	suppression theoretically enables a temporal separation of thalamically
	driven mono- and disynaptic EPSPs, resulting in spike sequences of
	'L4 leading L2/3'. By recording L4 and L2/3 cells simultaneously,
	we found that suppression of IPSPs could lead to deterioration of
	spike sequences. Thus, from the end of the second postnatal week,
	by activating GABAergic neurons prior to excitatory neurons from
	the thalamus, fast feedforward disynaptic suppression on postsynaptic
	cells may play a role in establishing the spike sequences of 'L4
	leading L2/3 cells'.},

	task and could accurately discriminate between apertures of very
	similar width. Accurate discriminations required a large number of

	In different groups of rats, different sets of whiskers were removed

	array are functionally equivalent during performance of this task.
	Lesions of the barrel cortex abolished the ability of rats to discriminate,

	behavior. Interestingly, sectioning the facial nerve, which abolished
	whisker movements, did not affect the ability to perform accurate
	discriminations, indicating that active whisker movements are not

	representations of external stimuli (in this case, aperture width)
	by integrating tactile input from many functionally equivalent facial
	whiskers and that the vibrissal array can function as a fine-grained
	distance detector without active whisker movements.},

  abstract = {1. Carbon fiber multibarrel glass microelectrodes were used to record
	extracellular single-unit activity during microiontophoretic application
	of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or bicuculline methiodide (BMI)
	onto layer IV barrel neurons in the somatosensory cortex of fentanyl-sedated
	rats. Excitatory and inhibitory aspects of the neurons' receptive
	fields were quantified with the use of controlled whisker stimuli.
	The principally activating whisker and one of its immediately adjacent
	neighbors were deflected alone or in paired combinations involving
	a condition-test paradigm. 2. Units were distinguished electrophysiologically
	on the basis of the time course of their action potential waveforms.
	Data were obtained from 26 regular-spike units (RSUs; presumed spiny
	stellate cells) and 7 fast-spike units (FSUs; presumed GABAergic
	neurons). An average of 15.0 nA of GABA produced a one-third to one-half
	reduction in RSU responses evoked by the maximally effective stimulus.
	An average of 8.7 nA of BMI was needed to counteract this reduction.
	This amount of BMI, in the absence of exogenous GABA, was found to
	increase average RSU and FSU responses by 98 and 53\%, respectively,
	relative to predrug levels. 3. For RSUs, the BMI-induced twofold
	increase in responses evoked by moving the principal whisker at the
	neuron's best deflection angle was accompanied by an almost threefold
	increase in responses evoked by similarly moving an adjacent whisker.
	Disproportionately large percentage increases were also seen for
	responses to nonpreferred directions of principal and adjacent whisker
	movement. BMI thus effectively increased receptive field size and
	decreased angular tuning. Similarly, responses to stimulus offsets,
	which are normally smaller than ON responses, were increased proportionally
	more. 4. Predrug responses of FSUs were more vigorous than those
	of RSUs. However, FSUs showed a similar inverse relationship between
	percentage increase with BMI and initial response magnitude, although
	the proportional increases were less pronounced. 5. GABA, like BMI,
	had the greatest proportional effects on those responses that were
	initially smallest. It produced results opposite those of BMI, effectively
	decreasing receptive field size and sharpening angular tuning. 6.
	A previously described computational model of a barrel was tested
	for its ability to reproduce quantitatively the effects of BMI and
	GABA. The application of BMI was simulated by decreasing the strength
	of the inhibitory inputs onto the particular cell under study in
	the model network. GABA microiontophoresis was simulated by adding
	a constant hyperpolarizing voltage. The model RSUs and FSUs displayed
	proportional changes in response magnitude that were quantitatively
	similar to those of their biological counterparts. 7. Surround inhibition
	was greatly attenuated by BMI application, both for the real and
	simulated barrel neurons. Disinhibition was less pronounced for the
	former, perhaps because, unlike the simulated neurons, they also
	possess GABAB receptors, which are unaffected by BMI. 8. We conclude
	that the inhibitory receptive field properties of barrel neurons
	can be explained by intrabarrel inhibition and that the expansion
	of receptive field size and loss of angular tuning with BMI is due
	to an enhanced effectiveness of convergent, multi-whisker thalamocortical
	input. Examination of the model neurons' behavior suggests that the
	altered activity in response to GABA or BMI application, respectively,
	can be explained by the nonlinear effects of shifting somal membrane
	potential away from or toward the neuron's firing threshold.},

	described differences between the response properties of thalamic
	and cortical vibrissa neurons and proposed that these transformations
	can be explained by several features of barrel anatomy and physiology:
	nonlinear neuronal properties, strongly responsive inhibitory and
	less responsive excitatory neurons, convergent thalamic inputs to
	cells of both types, and interconnections among barrel neurons. In
	the present study these features were incorporated into a computational
	model in order to test their explanatory power quantitatively. The
	relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory cells and the relative
	numbers of synapses of thalamic and intrabarrel origin were chosen
	to be consistent with available light and electron microscopic data.
	Known functional differences between excitatory and inhibitory barrel
	neurons were simulated through differences in spike activation functions,
	refractory periods, postsynaptic potential decay rates, and synaptic
	strengths. The model network was activated by spike trains recorded
	previously from thalamic neurons in response to three different whisker
	deflection protocols, and output, which consisted of spikes generated
	by the simulated neurons, was compared to data from our previous
	neurophysiological experiments. For each type of whisker stimulus,
	the same set of parameter values yielded accurate simulations of

	inputs from a number of thalamic and other barrel neurons and where
	the ratios between network excitation, network inhibition, and thalamic
	excitation were approximately constant. Several quantities are defined
	that may be generally useful in characterizing neuronal networks.
	One important implication of the results is that thalamic relay neurons

	barreloid receives input from one principal whisker and inhibitory
	inputs from reticular thalamic neurons with receptive fields that
	correspond to that same whisker. Although the proximal dendrites
	of relay cells are confined to their home barreloid, distal dendrites
	often extend into surrounding barreloids representing adjacent whiskers
	on the mystacial pad. It was proposed that this arrangement provides
	a substrate for a mechanism of lateral inhibition that operates remotely
	on extrabarreloid dendrites. In the present study, we identified
	adjacent whiskers that suppressed activity below background levels
	in barreloid cells, and we used a double-labeling protocol to relate
	the efficacy of inhibition to the dendroarchitecture of the cells.
	Significant suppression of background discharges was produced by
	92\% of adjacent whiskers within rows, by 48\% of adjacent whiskers
	within arcs, but was never observed after deflection of nonadjacent
	whiskers. The magnitude of lateral inhibition increases linearly
	as the cumulated length of dendrites increases in the barreloid representing
	an adjacent whisker (R2 = 0.86; p < 0.0001). As distance between
	cell bodies and the border of an adjacent barreloid increases, dendritic
	length in that adjacent barreloid diminishes and so does inhibition.
	Considering time differences between the arrival of principal and
	adjacent whisker inputs in barreloids, our data suggest that inhibition
	operating distally on dendrites acts as a spatial filter that primarily
	suppresses adjacent whisker inputs and so contributes to enhance

	Subthreshold but also spiking receptive fields in the barrel cortex
	encompass a large number of vibrissae and it seems likely that the

	the multiple-whisker interactions encountered by the animal during
	exploration of its environment. The aim of this study was to examine
	the dependence of the spatial structure of cortical receptive fields
	on stimulus parameters. Using a newly developed 24-whisker stimulation
	matrix, we applied a forward correlation analysis of spiking activity
	to randomized whisker deflections (sparse noise) to characterize
	the receptive fields that result from caudal and rostral directions
	of whisker deflection. We observed that the functionally determined
	principal whisker, the whisker eliciting the strongest response with
	the shortest latency, differed according to the direction of whisker
	deflection. Thus, for a given neuron, maximal responses to opposite
	directions of whisker deflections could be spatially separated. This
	spatial separation resulted in a displacement of the center of mass
	between the rostral and caudal subfields and was accompanied by differences
	between response latencies in rostral and caudal directions of whisker
	deflection. Such direction-dependent receptive field organization
	was observed in every cortical layer. We conclude that the spatial
	structure of receptive fields in the barrel cortex is not an intrinsic
	property of the neuron but depends on the properties of sensory input.},

  abstract = {In their natural environment, rodents use their whiskers to locate
	and distinguish between objects of different textures and shapes.
	They do so by moving their whiskers actively as well as passively,
	through body and head movements. To determine the mechanisms by which
	surface coarseness is translated into neuronal discharges through
	passive whisker movements, we monitored head movements of awake behaving
	rats while approaching objects. We then replayed these movements
	in anesthetized rats, monitored the whiskers' movements across various
	surfaces, and concurrently recorded the activity of first-order sensory
	neurons. We found that whiskers, being the first stage of sensory
	information translation, shape transduction by amplifying small-amplitude
	high-frequency signals. Thus, surface coarseness is transmitted through
	high-velocity micromotions. Consistent with this, we find that during
	surface contact, discrete high-velocity movements, or stick-slip
	events, evoke first-order neuronal discharge. Transient ringing in
	whiskers, which primarily represents resonance vibrations, follows
	these events, but seldom causes neurons to discharge. These sensory
	transformations are influenced by the whiskers' biomechanical properties.
	To determine the resemblance of these tactile transformations during
	passive whisker movements and active whisking, we induced artificial
	whisking across various surface textures. We found that the processes
	by which tactile information becomes available to the animal are
	similar for these different modes of behavior. Together, these findings
	indicate that the temporal bandpass properties for spike generation
	in first-order neurons are matched by the biomechanical characteristics
	of whiskers, which translate surface coarseness into high-frequency
	whisker micromotions. These properties enable rodents to acquire

  abstract = {Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurones constitute a major sub- and intracortical
	output of the somatosensory cortex. This layer 5 is segregated into
	layers 5A and 5B which receive and distribute relatively independent
	afferent and efferent pathways. We performed in vivo whole-cell recordings
	from L5 neurones of the somatosensory (barrel) cortex of urethane-anaesthetized
	rats (aged 27-31 days). By delivering 6 deg single whisker deflections,
	whisker pad receptive fields were mapped for 16 L5A and 11 L5B neurones
	located below the layer 4 whisker-barrels. Average resting membrane
	potentials were -75.6 +/- 1.1 mV, and spontaneous action potential
	(AP) rates were 0.54 +/- 0.14 APs s(-1). Principal whisker (PW) evoked
	responses were similar in L5A and L5B neurones, with an average 5.0
	+/- 0.6 mV postsynaptic potential (PSP) and 0.12 +/- 0.03 APs per
	stimulus. The layer 5A sub- and suprathreshold receptive fields (RFs)
	were more confined to the principle whisker than those of layer 5B.
	The basal dendritic arbors of layer 5A and 5B cells were located
	below both layer 4 barrels and septa, and the cell bodies were biased
	towards the barrel walls. Responses in both L5A and L5B developed
	slowly, with onset latencies of 10.1 +/- 0.5 ms and peak latencies
	of 33.9 +/- 3.3 ms. Contralateral multi-whisker stimulation evoked
	PSPs similar in amplitude to those of PW deflections; whereas, ipsilateral
	stimulation evoked smaller and longer latency PSPs. We conclude that
	in L5 a whisker deflection is represented in two ways: focally by
	L5A pyramids and more diffusely by L5B pyramids as a result of combining
	different inputs from lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways. The relevant
	output evoked by a whisker deflection could be the ensemble activity
	in the anatomically defined cortical modules associated with a single
	or a few barrel-columns.},

  abstract = {Recently, the study of sensory cortex has focused on the context-dependent
	evolution of receptive fields and cortical maps over millisecond
	to second time-scales. This ARTICLE reviews advances in our understanding
	of these processes in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI).
	Subthreshold input to individual rat SI neurons is extensive, spanning
	several vibrissae from the center of the receptive field, and arrives
	within 25 ms of vibrissa deflection. These large subthreshold receptive
	fields provide a broad substrate for rapid excitatory and inhibitory
	multi-vibrissa interactions. The 'whisking' behavior, an approximately
	8 Hz ellipsoid movement of the vibrissae, introduces a context-dependent
	change in the pattern of vibrissa movement during tactile exploration.
	Stimulation of vibrissae over this frequency range modulates the
	pattern of activity in thalamic and cortical neurons, and, at the
	level of the cortical map, focuses the extent of the vibrissa representation
	relative to lower frequency stimulation (1 Hz). These findings suggest
	that one function of whisking is to reset cortical organization to
	improve tactile discrimination. Recent discoveries in primary visual
	cortex (VI) demonstrate parallel non-linearities in center-surround
	interactions in rat SI and VI, and provide a model for the rapid
	integration of multi-vibrissa input. The studies discussed in this
	ARTICLE suggest that, despite its original conception as a uniquely
	segregated cortex, rat SI has a wide array of dynamic interactions,
	and that the study of this region will provide insight into the general
	mechanisms of cortical dynamics engaged by sensory systems.},

  abstract = {The rodent whisker system is a major model for understanding neural
	mechanisms for tactile sensation of surface texture (roughness).
	Rats discriminate surface texture using the whiskers, and several
	theories exist for how texture information is physically sensed by
	the long, moveable macrovibrissae and encoded in spiking of neurons
	in somatosensory cortex. However, evaluating these theories requires
	a psychometric curve for texture discrimination, which is lacking.
	Here we trained rats to discriminate rough vs. fine sandpapers and
	grooved vs. smooth surfaces. Rats intermixed trials at macrovibrissa
	contact distance (nose >2 mm from surface) with trials at shorter
	distance (nose <2 mm from surface). Macrovibrissae were required
	for distant contact trials, while microvibrissae and non-whisker
	tactile cues were used for short distance trials. A psychometric
	curve was measured for macrovibrissa-based sandpaper texture discrimination.
	Rats discriminated rough P150 from smoother P180, P280, and P400
	sandpaper (100, 82, 52, and 35 µm mean grit size, respectively).
	Use of olfactory, visual, and auditory cues was ruled out. This is

	By reconstructing the 3D patterns of intracortical axon projections
	from individual slender- and thick-tufted neurons, filled in vivo
	with biocytin, we were able to identify cell type-specific intracortical
	circuits that may encode whisker motion and touch. Individual slender-tufted

	of large portions of the vibrissal area (total length, 86.8 ± 5.5
	mm). During active whisking, these long-range projections may modulate
	and phase-lock the membrane potential of dendrites in layers 2 and
	3 to the whisking cycle. Thick-tufted neurons with soma locations
	intermingling with those of slender-tufted ones display less dense
	intracortical axon projections (total length, 31.6 ± 14.3 mm) that

	reconstructions and previous measurements of spiking, we put forward
	the hypothesis that thick-tufted neurons in rat vibrissal cortex
	receive input of whisker motion from slender-tufted neurons onto
	their apical tuft dendrites and input of whisker touch from thalamic
	neurons onto their basal dendrites. During tactile-driven behavior,
	such as object location, near-coincident input from these two pathways
	may result in increased spiking activity of thick-tufted neurons
	and thus enhanced signaling to their subcortical targets.},

	Large-scale confinement of neuronal arbors to single barrels was
	suggested by restricted lateral diffusion of DiI across septa between
	barrels. Morphological analysis of dendritic and axonal arborizations
	of individual excitatory neurons showed that neuronal processes remain
	within the barrel of origin through polarization toward the center

	EPSPs, which were found to attenuate at barrel borders. This ensemble
	property of a layer 4 barrel was further investigated by analyzing
	the connectivity of pairs of excitatory neurons with respect to the
	locations of the somata. Approximately one-third of the excitatory
	neurons within the same barrel were synaptically coupled. At the
	septum between adjacent barrels the connectivity dropped rapidly,

	Single and dual WC recordings from pyramidal cells indicated a strong

	arbor of barrel-column-related pyramids in L2/3. The horizontal spread
	of excitation remained confined to a single barrel-column with weak
	whisker deflection. With intermediate deflections, excitation spread
	into adjacent barrel-columns, propagating twofold more rapidly along
	the rows of the barrel field than across the arcs, consistent with
	the preferred axonal arborizations in L2/3 of reconstructed pyramidal

	in the central trigeminal whisker representations that document neurons
	tuned to the direction of whisker deflection, there is no behavioral
	evidence to date that rats can use their whiskers to discriminate
	between object orientations. In the present study, we characterized
	whisker-dependent orientation discrimination using a one-trial learning
	procedure. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained and tested in a three-arm
	'Y-maze' that was outfitted with 180 independently moveable bars
	that protruded into the arms of the maze to contact the whiskers.
	On the first day, the maze was configured to have two arms with only
	horizontal bars and a third arm with only vertical bars and rats
	were allowed to freely explore all arms. On the second day, rats
	were isolated in one arm that contained only vertical bars as a conditioned
	stimulus (CS) and administered three mild foot shocks. On the third
	day, the maze was configured identically to the first day and rats
	were once again allowed to freely explore the maze. We measured the
	percentage of time spent in each arm of the maze and found that most
	rats spent significantly less time in the arm containing the CS after
	training compared to before training. Subsequent control experiments
	determined that the conditioned avoidance was attributable to orientation
	cues, was caused by the association of the conditioned and unconditioned
	stimulus and was whisker-dependent. Avoidance behavior was significantly
	reduced when the difference between the conditioned and non-conditioned
	orientation difference was reduced to 45 degrees. Thus, rats can
	discriminate object orientation with their whiskers and an estimate
	of their discrimination thresholds can be rapidly acquired through
	the application of a one-trial learning paradigm.},

  abstract = {Sensory information, relayed through the thalamus, arrives in the

	inhibition that constrains the cortical flow of excitation both spatially
	and temporally. This feedforward inhibition is generated by intracortical
	interneurons whose precise identity and properties were not known.
	To characterize interneurons generating feedforward inhibition, neurons
	in layers IV and V of mouse somatosensory ("barrel") cortex in vitro
	were tested in the cell-attached configuration for thalamocortically
	induced firing and in the whole-cell mode for synaptic responses.
	Identification as inhibitory or excitatory neurons was based on intrinsic
	firing patterns and on morphology revealed by intracellular staining.
	Thalamocortical stimulation evoked action potentials in approximately
	60\% of inhibitory interneurons but in <5\% of excitatory neurons.
	The inhibitory interneurons that fired received fivefold larger thalamocortical
	inputs compared with nonfiring inhibitory or excitatory neurons.
	Thalamocortically evoked spikes in inhibitory interneurons followed
	at short latency the onset of excitatory monosynaptic responses in
	the same cells and slightly preceded the onset of inhibitory responses
	in nearby neurons, indicating their involvement in disynaptic inhibition.
	Both nonadapting (fast-spiking) and adapting (regular-spiking) inhibitory
	interneurons fired on thalamocortical stimulation, as did interneurons
	expressing parvalbumin, calbindin, or neither calcium-binding protein.
	Morphological analysis revealed that some interneurons might generate
	feedforward inhibition within their own layer IV barrel, whereas
	others may convey inhibition to upper layers, within their own or
	in adjacent columns. We conclude that feedforward inhibition is generated
	by diverse classes of interneurons, possibly serving different roles
	in the processing of incoming sensory information.},

  abstract = {Neurons throughout the rat vibrissa somatosensory pathway are sensitive
	to the angular direction of whisker movement. Could this sensitivity
	help rats discriminate stimuli? Here we use a simple computational
	model of cortical neurons to analyze the robustness of directional
	selectivity. In the model, directional preference emerges from tuning
	of synaptic conductance amplitude and latency, as in recent experimental
	findings. We find that directional selectivity during stimulation
	with random deflection sequences is strongly dependent on the mean
	deflection frequency: Selectivity is weakened at high frequencies
	even when each individual deflection evokes strong directional tuning.
	This variability of directional selectivity is due to generic properties
	of synaptic integration by the neuronal membrane, and is therefore
	likely to hold under very general physiological conditions. Our results
	suggest that directional selectivity depends on stimulus context.
	It may participate in tasks involving brief whisker contact, such
	as detection of object position, but is likely to be weakened in
	tasks involving sustained whisker exploration (e.g., texture discrimination).},

  abstract = {Previous work has established that during exploration and discrimination,
	rats move their whiskers at frequencies between 6 and 12 Hz and that
	whisking frequency changes during contact. One critical component
	of any tactile system is contact. In the rat whisker system, such
	contacts may involve one or more vibrissa in the whisker array and
	contact duration of each whisker may vary over a considerable range,
	depending upon the behavioral context. However, little is known about
	the variables controlling contact duration or about the temporal
	relationships among contacts by adjacent whiskers. To address these
	issues head fixed rats were trained to touch a piezo-contact-sensor
	with the shaft of their whiskers (Bermejo and Zeigler, Somatosens
	Mot Res 17: 373-377, 2000). During the task, whisker movements and
	contacts were monitored with a high-speed camera at 500 frames/s
	and stored on videotape. To facilitate analysis, animals had their
	whiskers selectively trimmed. Data are reported from animals with
	C1 \& C2, D1 \& D2, or Arc2 (E2, D2, C2, B2) whiskers intact. For
	both row and arc animals, when just a single whisker touched the
	sensor the duration of contact was significantly shorter than when
	multiple whiskers made contact. When multiple whiskers made contact,
	onset was rarely simultaneous. Furthermore, in row-intact animals,
	contact progressed in an orderly fashion such that the rostral whisker
	in a row made contact first followed 24 ms (SE = 1.9 ms) later by
	the caudal whisker. When contact reversed the caudal whisker lifted
	off first, followed by the rostral whisker. Thus, the order in which
	whiskers touch an object regulates contact duration: the first whisker
	to touch the sensor stays in contact longer than any other whisker.
	The temporal discharge properties of neurons in the trigeminal system
	are expected to reflect position of whiskers on the nose.},

	on each side of the face move in synchrony. To determine whether
	whiskers are constrained to move together, we trained rats to use
	two whiskers on the same side of the face in simple behavioral tasks
	and videotaped the whiskers during the task. Here we report that
	the movement of adjacent whiskers is usually synchronous but can
	diverge: 1) the distance between whiskers can vary dramatically during
	movement; 2) one whisker can move while the second one remains stationary;
	3) two whiskers can simultaneously move in opposite directions; and
	4) one whisker can be maintained in contact with an object while
	the other is retracted and protracted. The frequency of whisker movement
	during the task falls within the previously reported range for rats
	whisking freely into air or performing roughness discrimination with
	their whiskers. Our data also suggest that whisker movement can be
	divided into three distinct phases: protraction, retraction, and
	a measurable delay between these movements. We conclude that, although
	whiskers often move in concert, adjacent caudal whiskers can be moved
	independently of each other.},

	spiny neurons and L2/3 pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex. It is
	based first on a detailed morphological and functional characterization
	of synaptically connected pairs of L4-L2/3 neurons from in vitro
	recordings and second, on in vivo recordings of voltage responses
	of L2/3 pyramidal cells to current pulses and to whisker deflection.
	In vitro data and a detailed compartmental model of L2/3 pyramidal
	cells enabled us to extract their specific membrane resistivity (
	approximately 16,000 ohms x cm(2)) and capacitance ( approximately
	0.8 microF/cm(2)) and the spatial distribution of L4-L2/3 synaptic
	contacts. The average peak conductance per L4 synaptic contact is
	0.26 nS for the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
	acid and 0.2 nS for NMDA receptors. The in vivo voltage response
	for current steps was then used to calibrate the model for in vivo
	conditions in the Down state. Consequently, the effect of a single
	whisker deflection was modeled by converging, on average, 350 +/-
	20 L4 axons onto the modeled L2/3 pyramidal cell. Based on values
	of synaptic conductance, the spatial distribution of L4 synapses
	on L2/3 dendrites, and the average in vivo spiking probability of
	L4 spiny neurons, the model predicts that the feed-forward L4-L2/3
	connection on its own does not fire the L2/3 neuron. With a broader
	distribution in the number of L4 neurons or with slight synchrony
	among them, the L2/3 model does spike with low probability.},

	At the level of neuronal populations, the whisker map varied smoothly

	methods were devised to verify the hypothesis that Dirichlet domains
	accurately describe the adult barrel fields of normal mice. We found
	that normal barrel fields and abnormal barrel fields caused by supernumerary

	this mathematical formalism. This implies that each developing cortical
	barrel organizes about a center point. Experiments in neonatal animals

	afferent (TCA) distributions. These results support an hypothesis
	in which TCAs are the nucleating agents causing barrels to organize
	as Dirichlet domains. This is made possible because TCA terminals
	from each barreloid (a whisker-related group of cells in the ventrobasal
	complex of the thalamus) initially colonize somatosensory cortex
	with an approximately "Gaussian" distribution. These peaked groups
	of related TCAs behave as Dirichlet domain centers. They generate
	barrel structures competitively, in animals with normal or with perturbed
	whisker patterns, via statistical epigenetic interactions within

	This leads to selective axon outgrowth and pruning of single TCA
	branches, regulated by the TCA population, and creates beneath each
	Gaussian the dense knot of related TCA arbors typical of the barrel
	cortex. Similar parcellation of neuronal processes into contending
	subgroups having spatially coherent actions could lead to nucleation

	was 1.3 +/- 1.3, 3.4 +/- 2.3, and 2.8 +/- 4.5 msec for neurons in
	layers II/III, IV, and V/VI, respectively. These ISIs corresponded
	to the difference in latencies between the responses to the individual
	stimulations of the principal and adjacent whiskers. A significant
	response facilitation was observed in the regular-spiking cells but
	not in the fast-spiking cells. When the ISI was longer than the range
	that evoked facilitation, a suppression of the response to the second
	whisker stimulation was observed. Facilitation was observed predominantly
	in layer II/III cells (69\%) and to a lesser extent in cells of layers
	IV (15\%) and V/VI (24\%). Our results suggest that, in the barrel
	cortex, the temporal relationships among tactile stimuli are coded
	by facilitatory and inhibitory interactions among neurons located
	in neighboring barrel columns.},

	in the function of cortical barrel circuits and to behavioral deficits
	later in life. Here we examined how whisker trimming begun either
	at birth (P0) or on postnatal day 12 (P12), around the onset of whisking
	behavior, affects receptive fields of layer IV barrel neurons. All
	whiskers on the left face were trimmed for 40-45 days and then allowed
	to regrow fully. Extracellular single-unit recordings and controlled
	deflections of principal and adjacent whiskers (PW and AW, respectively),
	individually or in paired combinations, were used to assess excitatory
	and suppressive effects of neighboring whiskers on barrel neurons.
	Results indicate that whisker trimming both from P0 and P12 leads
	to enlarged excitatory and weakened inhibitory receptive fields in
	layer IV neurons. PW- and AW-evoked responses are larger in magnitude
	in trimmed than in control animals; AW-evoked responses are disproportionately
	affected, decreasing the spatial focus of barrel neurons. Deprivation
	after P12 accounts for approximately 50\% of the total effect observed
	in P0 trimmed animals. Suppressive interactions, evoked by two whiskers
	deflected in succession, are weaker in trimmed than in control animals.
	Suppressive caudal/rostral and ventral/dorsal gradients, however,
	seem unaffected by sensory deprivation. Thus the developmental period
	during which experience persistently modifies maturing barrel circuitry
	extends up to and likely beyond the onset of whisking behavior. Sensory
	deprivation during this time affects development of both excitatory
	and inhibitory receptive fields of barrel neurons and likely impairs
	cortical integration of sensory information from multiple whiskers.},

  abstract = {Glass micropipettes were used to record the activity of 124 single
	units in the somatosensory vibrissa cortex (SI) of 16 rats in response
	to combined deflections of contralateral vibrissae. Compact multiangular
	electromechanical stimulators were used to stimulate individual vibrissal
	hairs alone or in combinations of two or three adjacent whiskers.
	Each whisker was stimulated independently to produce controlled temporal
	and spatial patterns of mechanical stimuli. Following displacement
	of a vibrissa, unit discharges to subsequent deflections of adjacent
	whiskers are reduced in a time-dependent fashion. Response suppression
	is strongest at short interdeflection intervals, i.e., 10-20 ms and
	decreases progressively during the 50-100 ms following the first
	deflection. In many cases this period also corresponds with a reduction
	in ongoing unit discharges. Response suppression was not observed
	for first-order neurons recorded in the trigeminal ganglion of barbiturate-anesthetized
	rats. In the cortex, the presence and/or degree of response suppression
	depends on a number of spatial factors. These include 1) the angular
	direction(s) in which the individual hairs are moved, 2) the sequence
	in which two whiskers are deflected, that is, which one is deflected
	first, 3) the particular combination of whiskers stimulated, and
	4) the number (2 or 3) of vibrissae comprising the multiwhisker stimulus.
	Within a vertical electrode penetration, one particular whisker typically
	elicits the strongest excitatory and inhibitory effects; other, nearby
	vibrissae elicit variable (or no) excitation or inhibition. Excitatory
	and inhibitory subregions of a receptive field could thus be distributed
	asymmetrically around the maximally effective whisker. In these cases,
	the receptive fields displayed spatial orientations. Quantitative
	criteria were used to classify 30 cortical units on the basis of
	the distribution of inhibitory subregions on either side of the maximally
	effective whisker. Twenty-one of these cells had receptive fields
	(RFs) with symmetrical inhibitory side regions. Responses of the
	other nine units were strongly suppressed by a preceding deflection
	of a vibrissa on one side but relatively unaffected, or even slightly
	facilitated, by preceding deflection of the whisker on the other
	side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	"fast" cortical spikes (FS) were less frequently encountered and
	largely restricted to layer IV. Although both types of potentials
	had similar negative-positive waveforms. FSs were distinguished from
	RSs by their comparatively rapid time course, about half that of
	RSs. RS units (RSU) discharged spontaneously at rates of less than
	1--15/s, whereas FS units (FSU) displayed rates of 15--50/s. The
	amplitudes of FSs, which were generally smaller than those of RSs,
	often decreased during high-frequency discharges. 3. With sinusoidal
	oscillations of a vibrissa FSUs responded more reliably and over
	a broader range of frequencies (3 to at least 40 Hz) than did RSUs
	, particularly in layer IV. In addition, FSUs typically responded
	to whisker deflections over a range of 360 degrees, whereas many
	RSUs in layer IV displayed sharp spatial-tuning charcteristics, responding
	over a restricted range of less than 90 degrees. 4. Of all units,
	58\% responded preferentially to stimulus transients (vibrissal movements),
	32\% displayed sustained responses to stimulus stead-states (fixed
	vibrissal displacement). For the remaining 10\% of units the appropriate
	stimulus could not be specified; these units were particularly common
	in layer V. 5. Computation of quantitative stimulus-response relations
	showed that many units increased their rate of discharge with increasing
	stimulus intensities. 6. Most units were directionally selective,
	responding preferentially to deflections of a whisker in one or more
	of four quadrants. 7. In radial penetrations through the cortex there
	was a columnar patern so that units were activated at least by the
	same (i.e., the "principal") whisker. In a number of cases these
	could be directly correlated with the barrels. Of all units, 55\%

	units the responses elicited by deflection of any one hair activating
	the neuron was qualitatively similar to those elicited by deflection
	of any other hair activating it. The principal whisker of the penetration
	was typically associated with the most vigorous responses. 8. In
	layer IV, 85\% of neurons responded to deflections of one hair only,
	the remaining 15\% to two or more hairs. In layers II and III 39\%

  abstract = {1. Extracellular single-unit recordings and controlled whisker stimuli
	were used to compare response properties between cells in the "barreloids"
	of the thalamic ventrobasal complex and those in the cytochrome oxidase-rich
	centers of the "barrels" in the first somatic sensory cortex. Individual
	vibrissae were deflected alone or in paired combination involving
	the neuron's maximally excitatory whisker and an adjacent one in
	the same or neighboring whisker rows. Quantitative data were derived
	from 135 thalamocortical unit's (TCUs), 242 "regular-spike" barrel
	units (RSUs), and 16 "fast-spike" barrel units (FSUs) recorded in
	26 normal adult rats. 2. Compared with TCUs, RSUs displayed lower
	rates of spontaneous activity and responded less vigorously to whisker
	stimuli. Proportionally, more than twice as many TCUs as RSUs responded
	in slowly adapting fashion to at least one angular direction of whisker
	displacement. Discharges of slowly adapting TCUs were approximately
	3.5 times greater than those of slowly adapting RSUs. 3. Proportionally,
	about twice as many TCUs than RSUs responded selectively to whisker
	movements in different angular directions. 4. Cells in the thalamus
	responded more vigorously to a larger number of whiskers than RSUs
	in the cortex. Depending on the stimulus conditions, two to three
	times more TCUs than RSUs were excited by two or more whiskers. 5.
	Following displacement of an adjacent whisker, unit discharges to
	subsequent deflections of the maximally excitatory whisker were reduced
	in a time-dependent fashion. The time course of response suppression
	was similar in TCUs and RSUs, but inhibitory interactions between
	adjacent whiskers were observed much less often in the thalamus.
	A cyclic pattern of stimulus-evoked excitation/inhibition characterizes
	responses in the cortical barrels but is considerably less pronounced
	in the thalamic barreloids. 6. The presence and/or degree of response
	suppression depended on which adjacent whisker was stimulated and
	on the angular direction of that whisker's movement. For individual
	TCUs, some adjacent whiskers evoked inhibition, others did not. The
	vast majority of RSUs displayed response suppression to all adjacent
	whiskers. Unlike receptive fields of TCUs, those of RSUs have small--i.e.,
	single-whisker--excitatory centers with potent and symmetrical inhibitory
	surrounds. 7. Fast-spike units in the barrels displayed the greatest
	spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activities and were the least selective

  abstract = {Integration of inputs by cortical neurons provides the basis for the
	complex information processing performed in the cerebral cortex.
	Here, we have examined how primary visual cortical neurons integrate
	classical and nonclassical receptive field inputs. The effect of
	nonclassical receptive field stimuli and, correspondingly, of long-range
	intracortical inputs is known to be context-dependent: the same long-range
	stimulus can either facilitate or suppress responses, depending on
	the level of local activation. By constructing a large-scale model
	of primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that this effect can be
	understood in terms of the local cortical circuitry. Each receptive
	field position contributes both excitatory and inhibitory inputs;
	however, the inhibitory inputs have greater influence when overall
	receptive field drive is greater. This mechanism also explains contrast-dependent
	modulations within the classical receptive field, which similarly
	switch between excitatory and inhibitory. In order to simplify analysis
	and to explain the fundamental mechanisms of the model, self-contained
	modules that capture nonlinear local circuit interactions are constructed.
	This work supports the notion that receptive field integration is
	the result of local processing within small groups of neurons rather
	than in single neurons.},

  abstract = {How does processing of information change the internal representations
	used in subsequent stages of sensory pathways? To approach this question,
	we studied the representations of whisker movements in the lemniscal
	and paralemniscal pathways of the rat vibrissal system. We recently
	suggested that these two pathways encode movement frequency in different
	ways. We proposed that paralemniscal thalamocortical circuits, functioning
	as phase-locked loops (PLLs), translate temporally coded information
	into a rate code. Here we focus on the two major trigeminal nuclei
	of the brain stem, nucleus principalis and subnucleus interpolaris,
	and on their thalamic targets, the ventral posteromedial nucleus
	(VPM) and the medial division of the posterior nucleus (POm). This
	is the first study in which these brain stem and thalamic nuclei
	were explored together in the same animals and using the same stimuli.
	We studied both single- and multi-unit activity. We moved the whiskers
	both mechanically and by air puffs; here we present air-puff-induced
	movements because they are more similar to natural movements than
	movements induced by mechanical stimulations. We describe the basic
	properties of the responses in these brain stem and thalamic nuclei.
	The responses in both brain stem nuclei were similar; responses to
	air puffs were mostly tonic and followed the trajectory of whisker
	movement. The responses in the two thalamic nuclei were similar during
	low-frequency stimulations or during the first pulses of high-frequency
	stimulations, exhibiting more phasic responses than those of brain
	stem neurons. However, with frequencies >2 Hz, VPM and POm responses
	differed, generating different representations of the stimulus frequency.
	In the VPM, response amplitudes (instantaneous firing rates) and
	spike counts (total number of spikes per stimulus cycle) decreased
	as a function of the frequency. In the POm, latencies increased and
	spike count decreased as a function of the frequency. Having described
	the basic response properties in the four nuclei, we then focus on
	a specific test of our PLL hypothesis for coding in the paralemniscal
	pathway. We used short-duration air puffs, much shorter than whisker
	movements during natural whisking. The activity in this situation
	was consistent with the prediction we made on the basis of the PLL

  abstract = {Intracortical inhibition plays a role in shaping sensory cortical
	receptive fields and is mediated by both feed-forward and feedback
	mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition is the faster of the two processes,
	being generated by inhibitory interneurons driven by monosynaptic
	thalamocortical (TC) input. In principle, feed-forward inhibition
	can prevent targeted cortical neurons from ever reaching threshold
	when TC input is weak. To do so, however, inhibitory interneurons
	must respond to TC input at low thresholds and generate spikes very
	quickly. A powerful feed-forward inhibition would sharpen the tuning
	characteristics of targeted cortical neurons, and interneurons with
	sensitive and broadly tuned receptive fields could mediate this process.
	Suspected inhibitory interneurons (SINs) with precisely these properties
	are found in layer 4 of the somatosensory (S1) 'barrel' cortex of
	rodents and rabbits. These interneurons lack the directional selectivity
	seen in most cortical spiny neurons and in ventrobasal TC afferents,
	but are much more sensitive than cortical spiny neurons to low-amplitude
	whisker displacements. This paper is concerned with the activation
	of S1 SINs by TC impulses, and with the consequences of this activation.
	Multiple TC neurons and multiple S1 SINs were simultaneously studied
	in awake rabbits, and cross-correlation methods were used to examine
	functional connectivity. The results demonstrate a potent, temporally
	precise, dynamic and highly convergent/divergent functional input
	from ventrobasal TC neurons to SINs of the topographically aligned
	S1 barrel. Whereas the extensive pooling of convergent TC inputs
	onto SINs generates sensitive and broadly tuned inhibitory receptive
	fields, the potent TC divergence onto many SINs generates sharply
	synchronous activity among these elements. This TC feed-forward inhibitory
	network is well suited to provide a fast, potent, sensitive and broadly
	tuned inhibition of targeted spiny neurons that will suppress spike
	generation following all but the most optimal feed-forward excitatory
	inputs.},

  abstract = {Hubel and Wiesel (1977) suggested that ocular dominance and orientation
	columns in the macaque monkey striate cortex might be bands of uniform
	width that intersected orthogonally. They pointed out that if this
	were the case, there would be an equal allocation of cells of different
	orientation preference to each eye and to each point in visual space.
	However, orientation and ocular dominance columns have a more complex
	structural organization than is implied by this model: for example,
	iso-orientation domains do not intersect ocular dominance stripes
	at right angles and the two columnar systems have different periodicities.
	This raises the question as to how well the striate cortex manages
	to allocate equal numbers of neurons of different orientation preference
	to each eye and to each region of visual space, a factor referred
	to here as coverage. This paper defines a measure of uniformity of
	coverage, c', and investigates its dependence on several different
	parameters of columnar organisation. Calculations were done first
	using a simplified one-dimensional model of orientation and ocular
	dominance columns and were then repeated using more realistic two-dimensional
	models, generated with the algorithms described in the preceding
	paper (Swindale 1991). Factors investigated include the relative
	periodicities of the two columnar systems, the size of the cortical
	point image, the width of orientation tuning curves, whether columns
	are spatially anisotropic or not, and the role of the structural
	relationships between columns described by Blasdel and Salama (1986).
	The results demonstrate that coverage is most uniform when orientation
	hypercolumns are about half the size of ocular dominance hypercolumns.
	Coverage is most uneven when the hypercolumns are the same size,
	unless they are related in the way described by Blasdel and Salama,
	in which case coverage gets only slightly worse as the size ratio
	(ori/od) increases above 0.5. The minimum diameter of cortical point
	image that ensures reasonably uniform coverage is about twice the
	size of an ocular dominance hypercolumn i.e. about 1.5-2.0 mm.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the origins of multiwhisker-receptive fields
	of neurons in the thalamic ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus
	of the rat. We sought to determine whether multiwhisker-receptive
	field synthesis occurs in VPM through convergent projections from
	the principalis (PrV) and interpolaris (SpVi) nuclei, or in PrV by
	intersubnuclear projections from the spinal trigeminal complex. We
	tested these hypotheses by recording whisker-evoked responses in
	PrV and VPM before and after electrolytic lesion of the SpVi in lightly
	anesthetized rats. Before the lesion PrV cells responded, on average,
	to 3.2 +/- 1.2 whiskers but responsiveness was reduced to 1.07 +/-
	0.31 whisker after the lesion. A similar reduction of receptive field
	size was observed in VPM, where neurons responded, on average, to
	2.94 +/- 0.95 whiskers before the lesion and to 1.05 +/- 0.22 whisker
	after the lesion. Thus one can conclude that intersubnuclear projections
	mediate surround whisker-receptive fields in PrV, and therefore in
	VPM. However, it has previously been shown that parasagittal brain
	stem transection, which severed ascending projections from SpVi,
	but left intersubnuclear connections intact, rendered VPM cells monowhisker
	responsive. We wondered whether midline brain stem lesion modified
	receptive field properties in SpVi. In normal rats SpVi cells responded,
	on average, to 7.52 +/- 4.25 whiskers, but responsiveness was dramatically
	reduced to 1.47 +/- 1.07 whisker after the lesion. Together these
	results indicate that the synthesis of surround receptive fields
	in subcortical stations relies almost exclusively on intersubnuclear
	projections from the spinal trigeminal complex to the PrV.},

	is shaped by the biomechanics, material properties, and the morphology
	of the peripheral sensory organs. The rat vibrissal (whisker) system
	is one of the premier models in neuroscience to study the relationship
	between physical embodiment of the sensor array and the neural circuits
	underlying perception. To date, however, the three-dimensional morphology
	of the vibrissal array has not been characterized. Quantifying array
	morphology is important because it directly constrains the mechanosensory
	inputs that will be generated during behavior. These inputs in turn
	shape all subsequent neural processing in the vibrissal-trigeminal
	system, from the trigeminal ganglion to primary somatosensory ("barrel")
	cortex. Here we develop a set of equations for the morphology of
	the vibrissal array that accurately describes the location of every
	point on every whisker to within ±5\% of the whisker length. Given
	only a whisker's identity (row and column location within the array),
	the equations establish the whisker's two-dimensional (2D) shape
	as well as three-dimensional (3D) position and orientation. The equations
	were developed via parameterization of 2D and 3D scans of six rat
	vibrissal arrays, and the parameters were specifically chosen to
	be consistent with those commonly measured in behavioral studies.
	The final morphological model was used to simulate the contact patterns
	that would be generated as a rat uses its whiskers to tactually explore
	objects with varying curvatures. The simulations demonstrate that
	altering the morphology of the array changes the relationship between
	the sensory signals acquired and the curvature of the object. The
	morphology of the vibrissal array thus directly constrains the nature
	of the neural computations that can be associated with extraction
	of a particular object feature. These results illustrate the key
	role that the physical embodiment of the sensor array plays in the
	sensing process.},

	their axonal arborizations were individually reconstructed from horizontal
	sections counterstained for cytochrome oxidase. Results show that
	the vast majority ( approximately 95\%) of layer 5 axons that innervate
	the somatosensory thalamus are collaterals of corticofugal fibers
	that project to the brainstem. The anterior pretectal nucleus, the
	deep layers of the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei are
	among the structures most often coinnervated. In the thalamus, layer
	5 axons terminate exclusively in the dorsal part of the posterior
	group (Po), where they form clusters of large terminations. Because
	dorsal Po projects to multiple cortical areas, we sought to determine
	whether all recipient areas return a layer 5 projection to this part
	of the thalamus. Additional experiments using fluoro-gold and BDA
	injections provided evidence that the primary somatosensory area
	is the sole source of layer 5 projections to dorsal Po but that this
	thalamic region receives convergent layer 6 projections from the
	primary and second somatosensory areas and from the motor and insular
	cortices. These results show that layer 5 projections do not overlap

	Furthermore, the coinnervation of brainstem nuclei by layer 5 CT
	axons suggests that this pathway conveys to the thalamus a copy of

  abstract = {Plasticity was induced in the barrel cortex of adolescent rats by
	depriving every second vibrissa on the contralateral vibrissa pad.
	This produced a chessboard pattern of barrels in the cortex where
	each barrel receiving its principal input from a spared vibrissa
	was surrounded by barrels for which the principal vibrissa had been
	deprived and conversely, each barrel receiving its principal input
	from a deprived vibrissa was surrounded by barrels for which the
	principal vibrissa had been spared. After 7 days' deprivation, responses
	to the regrown vibrissae were depressed in layers II/III (49\% of
	control levels) and IV (60\%). Depression was far greater than that
	seen with "all vibrissa" deprivation, suggesting that activity in
	the spared vibrissae accentuated the depression of the deprived vibrissae.
	Depression was not due to subcortical changes as thalamic Ventral
	Posterior Medial (VPM) responses to deprived vibrissa were unchanged.
	The short latency responses in layer IV (5-7 ms) were unaffected
	by deprivation, but the number of cells responding at intermediate
	latencies (8-13 ms) was markedly reduced (to 66\% of control). Potentiation
	of the spared vibrissa response was substantial in the near side
	of the neighbouring barrel (2.2-fold increase in layers II/III, 2.9-fold
	in layer IV) but had not spread to the far side after 7 days' deprivation.
	Sparing multiple vibrissae may increase the rate of potentiation
	since 7 days is insufficient time for potentiation in single vibrissa
	spared animals. Potentiation was not due to subcortical changes as
	thalamic VPm responses to the spared vibrissa were normal. However,
	in the spared barrel the response latency decreased by 1-2 ms. Only
	the cells responding at short latency exhibited potentiated responses
	(39\% increase) suggesting that some thalamocortical plasticity is
	still possible at P28-35. These results show that chessboard pattern
	deprivation is capable of inducing substantial plasticity over a
	wide area of barrel cortex. All the major forms of plasticity seen
	with other vibrissa deprivation patterns were present, although no
	other single deprivation pattern studied so far causes the complete

	fields, but the magnitude of the response depends on specific stimulus
	features. In the rodent whisker system, the response magnitude to
	the deflection of a particular whisker is, in most cells, dependent

	recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in layers 3 and 4 of the
	rat barrel cortex to elucidate the dynamics of the synaptic inputs
	underlying direction selectivity. We show that cells are direction
	selective despite a broadly tuned excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
	input. Selectivity emerges from a direction-dependent temporal shift
	of excitation relative to inhibition. For preferred direction deflections,
	excitation precedes inhibition, but as the direction diverges from
	the preferred, this separation decreases. Our results illustrate
	a mechanism by which the timing of the synaptic inputs, and not their
	relative peak amplitudes, primarily determine feature selectivity.},

  abstract = {We investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of activity in the rat

	slices, field potentials were recorded simultaneously from 60 electrodes
	with high spatial and temporal resolution. This new technique allowed
	us to map functionally discrete barrels and to observe the interplay
	between the excitatory and inhibitory network. The local field potentials
	(LFPs) were elicited by focal electrical stimulation in layer 4 (L4).
	Excitation recorded in a single barrel was first confined to the
	stimulated barrel and subsequently spread in a columnar manner to
	layer 2/3 (L2/3). This excitation in L4 and lower L2/3 was followed
	by inhibition curtailing excitation to a short period lasting only
	approximately 2 ms. In the uppermost layer, a long-lasting (approximately
	10 ms), laterally spreading band of excitation remained active. Blockade
	of GABAA-receptors resulted in a long-lasting and diffuse activation
	of L4 and lower L2/3 and abolition of activation of the upper L2/3.
	Thus inhibition not only shaped the spatial-temporal map of excitation
	in L4 and lower L2/3 but also resulted indirectly in an excitatory
	action in the superficial layers. Stimulation in L6 revealed a feedforward
	inhibition to L4 and subsequently an excitatory L6-L4-L6 loop. The
	complex interplay between excitation and inhibition opens two spatial
	windows of excitation in the infra- and supragranular layers. They
	may prepare the L5 pyramidal neuron for associating top-down input
	from other cortical regions with bottom-up input from the whisker
	pad to generate behaviorally relevant output.},

  abstract = {Rats discriminate surface textures using their whiskers (vibrissae),
	but how whiskers extract texture information, and how this information
	is encoded by the brain, are not known. In the resonance model, whisker
	motion across different textures excites mechanical resonance in
	distinct subsets of whiskers, due to variation across whiskers in
	resonance frequency, which varies with whisker length. Texture information
	is therefore encoded by the spatial pattern of activated whiskers.
	In the competing kinetic signature model, different textures excite
	resonance equally across whiskers, and instead, texture is encoded
	by characteristic, nonuniform temporal patterns of whisker motion.
	We tested these models by measuring whisker motion in awake, behaving
	rats whisking in air and onto sandpaper surfaces. Resonant motion
	was prominent during whisking in air, with fundamental frequencies
	ranging from approximately 35 Hz for the long Delta whisker to approximately
	110 Hz for the shorter D3 whisker. Resonant vibrations also occurred
	while whisking against textures, but the amplitude of resonance within
	single whiskers was independent of texture, contradicting the resonance
	model. Rather, whiskers resonated transiently during discrete, high-velocity,
	and high-acceleration slip-stick events, which occurred prominently
	during whisking on surfaces. The rate and magnitude of slip-stick
	events varied systematically with texture. These results suggest
	that texture is encoded not by differential resonant motion across
	whiskers, but by the magnitude and temporal pattern of slip-stick
	motion. These findings predict a temporal code for texture in neural

	whether this is true for layer V cells, we blocked intracortical

	lack of phasic inhibition evoked from sensory input compared with
	layer Va cells. The direct thalamic input to the layer V cells was
	not sufficient to evoke a sensory response in the absence of input
