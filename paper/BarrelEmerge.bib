In recent years, several key controls over the specification and differentiation of neocortical projection neurons have been identified. This work provides substantial insight into the {\textquoteleft}molecular logic{\textquoteright} underlying cortical development and increasingly supports a model in which individual progenitor-stage and postmitotic regulators are embedded within highly interconnected networks that gate sequential developmental decisions. Here, we provide an integrative account of the molecular controls that direct the progressive development and delineation of subtype and area identity of neocortical projection neurons.},

Here we provide evidence that FGF8 regulates development of the map from a source in the anterior telencephalon. Using electroporation-mediated gene transfer in mouse embryos, we show that augmenting the endogenous anterior FGF8 signal shifts area boundaries posteriorly, reducing the signal shifts them anteriorly, and introducing a posterior source of FGF8 elicits partial area duplications, revealed by ectopic somatosensory barrel fields. These findings support a role for FGF signaling in specifying positional identity in the neocortex.},

Within the cerebral cortex, the neocortex, or isocortex, is a 6-layered complexly organized structure that is comprised of multiple interconnected sensory and motor areas. These areas and their precise patterns of connections arise during development, through a process termed arealization. Intrinsic, activity-independent and extrinsic, activity-dependent mechanisms are involved in the development of neocortical areas and their connections. The intrinsic molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of this sophisticated network are not fully understood. In this report (I) and the companion report (II), we present the first lifespan analysis of ipsilateral intraneocortical connections (INCs) among multiple sensory and motor regions, from the embryonic period to adulthood in the mouse. Additionally, we characterize the neocortical expression patterns of several developmentally regulated genes that are of central importance to studies investigating the molecular control of arealization from embryonic day 13.5 to postnatal day (P) 3 (I) and P6 to 50 (II). In this analysis, we utilize novel methods to correlate the boundaries of gene expression with INCs and developing areal boundaries, in order to better understand the nature of gene{\textendash}areal relationships during development.},

Changes in the patterning of molecular markers and area-specific connections between the cortex and thalamus suggest that arealization of the neocortex is disproportionately altered in Emx2 andPax6 mutant mice in opposing manners predicted from their countergradients of expression: rostral areas expand and caudal areas contract in Emx2 mutants, whereas the opposite effect is seen in Pax6 mutants.

The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be further refined as more experimental facts become known.},

	abstract = {The thalamocortical projection to rodent somatosensory ({\textquotedblleft}barrell{\textquotedblright}) cortex is highly ordered in both the radial and the tangential dimensions. During a brief period of postnatal development, thalamocortical axons establish two tiers of terminations, in the deep layers and in layer IV, and form whisker-specific clusters within layer IV; however, little is known about the cues that guide them to their appropriate radial and tangential positions. To gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying this process, we studied the development of thalamocortical termination patterns in mouse barrel cortex at high spatial resolution. Developing thalamocortical axons were labeled in fixed slices with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye Dil and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope. On the day of birth (postnatal day 0, P0) axons coursed through layers VI and V, with little or no branching. By P2 the lower tier of terminations, at the border of layers VI and V, was clearly identifiable. Below this tier axons coursed obliquely or tangentially, forming a dense meshwork of intersecting fibers, but with no apparent branching. By P4 the upper tier of terminations, in layer IV, was clearly recognizable, and consisted of periodic, dense clusters of terminal arborizations. In marked contrast to the oblique and apparently disorderly course followed by axons in layer VI and lower layer V, axons in upper layer V heading toward the upper tier were organized in loose bundles running radially, suggesting that axons destined to terminate in a particular layer IV barrel had already reached their appropriate tangential coordinates within the lower tier. Thus, the pattern of thalamocortical terminations in layer IV seems to be projected from the deep tier of terminations, and does not develop from an initially profuse arborization pattern through pruning of inappropriate branches.},

We took a new approach to determine the contribution of intracortical cues. The cortical patterning molecule fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) was misexpressed in the cortical primordium to rearrange the area map. Thalamic axons faithfully tracked changes in area position and innervated duplicated somatosensory barrel fields induced by an ectopic source of FGF8, indicating that thalamic axons indeed use intracortical positional information. Because cortical layers are generated in temporal order, FGF8 misexpression at different ages could be used to shift regional identity in the subplate and cortical plate either in or out of register. Thalamic axons showed strikingly different responses in the two different conditions, disclosing sources of positional guidance in both subplate and cortical plate. Unexpectedly, axon trajectories indicated that an individual neocortical layer could provide not only laminar but also area-specific guidance. Our findings demonstrate that thalamocortical axons are directed by sequential, positional cues within the cortex and implicate FGF8 as an indirect regulator of thalamocortical innervation.},

Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a morphogen that disperses from a rostromedial source in the neocortical primordium (NP), forms a rostral-to-caudal (R/C) gradient, and regulates embryonic and neonatal R/C patterns of gene expression in neocortex. Whether FGF8 also has organizer activity that generates the postnatal neocortical area map is uncertain. To test this possibility, new sources of FGF8 were introduced into the mouse NP with in utero microelectroporation at embryonic day 10.5, close to the estimated peak of area patterning. Results differed depending on the position of ectopic FGF8. Ectopic FGF8 in the caudalmost NP could duplicate somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary visual cortex (V1). FGF8 delivered to the midlateral NP generated a sulcus separating rostral and caudal portions of the NP, in effect creating duplicate NPs. In the caudal NP, ectopic FGF8 induced a second, inclusive area map, containing frontal cortex, S1, V1, and primary auditory areas. Moreover, duplicate S1 showed plasticity to sensory deprivation, and duplicate V1 responded to visual stimuli. Our findings implicate FGF8 as an organizer signal, and its source in the rostromedial telencephalon as an organizer of the neocortical area map.},

	abstract = {Telencephalic patterning centers, defined by the discrete expression domains of distinct morphogens, Fgf s in the commissural plate (CoP), Wnt s and Bmp s in the cortical hem, and a ventral domain of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are postulated to establish during development the initial patterning of the telencepahlon, including the neocortex. We show that the expression patterns of Sp5, Sp8, and Sp9, members of the Sp8-like family that are homologues of Drosophila buttonhead, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on Sp8, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of Fgf8, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used in utero electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between Sp8 and Fgf8 and their roles in cortical area patterning. We show that Fgf8 and Sp8 exhibit reciprocal induction in vivo in the embryonic telencephalon. Sp8 also induces downstream targets of Fgf8, including ETS transcription factors. In vitro assays show that Sp8 binds Fgf8 regulatory elements and is a direct transcriptional activator of Fgf8. We also show that Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is repressed by Emx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism to limit Fgf8 expression to the CoP. In vivo expression of a dominant negative Sp8 in the CoP indicates that Sp8 maintains expression of Fgf8 and also its effect on area patterning. Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of Sp8 on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of Fgf8, suggesting that in parallel to regulating Fgf8 expression, Sp8 also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning. In summary, Sp8 and Fgf8 robustly induce one another, and may act to balance the anterior-posterior area patterning of the cortex.},

	abstract = {In the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, the thalamocortical axons (TCAs) are organized into clusters that correspond to functional units in the periphery. Around these axons, neurons in layer IV aggregate as barrels. To understand how this organization emerges, we analyzed TCA development in mice that do not form barrels, the monoamine oxidase A knock-out (MAOA-KO), and in MAOA/5-HT1Breceptor double-KO mice, which have a restored barrel field. We show that TCAs already attain cortical layer IV on the day of birth. They are uniformly distributed in this layer from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P2 and secondarily coalesce into barrel domains in layer IV, over a 3 d period (P3{\textendash}P5), with no prepatterning in the deeper layers. In MAOA-KO mice, the uniform distribution of the TC projection is maintained, and no axon clusters emerge. Individual TCA arbors were traced after carbocyanine injections. At P1, TCAs were poorly branched and covered variable tangential widths, encompassing one to two prospective barrels. At P7 the number of TCA branches increased 10-fold in layer IV and became restricted to one barrel. In MAOA-KO mice, there was a 50\% reduction of the TCA terminal branches in layer IV, with a 40\% increase in their tangential extent. These defects were corrected in the MAOA/5-HT1B double knock-out mice, indicating an effect of the presynaptic 5-HT1B receptor on axon branching. Our results indicate that the barrel-deficient phenotype of MAOA-KO mice results from an altered refinement of the TCA arbors in their target layer IV, involving branch elaboration and collateral retraction during early postnatal life.},

	abstract = {The organization of the brainstem trigeminal complex (BTC) of the mouse is described, with emphasis on the normal organization of the vibrissal representations. Thionin staining for Nissl substance was employed to reveal the cytoarchitecture. Cytochrome oxidase histochemistry was used to reveal the chemoarchitecture. Golgi impregnation methods, in combination with thionin staining, were used to examine the neuronal dendritic morphology within a defined cytoarchitectonic context. An in vitro horseradish peroxidase labelling method was used to study the distribution and morphology of primary trigeminal afferent terminals within the BTC. The BTC consists of four distinct subnuclei: principalis (nVp), oralis (nVo), interpolaris (nVi), and caudalis (nVc). The present study shows that these sub-nuclei can be distinguished from each other on the basis of several anatomical criteria, including the distribution and density of neuronal size classes, histochemical staining intensity, morphology and orientation of neuronal dendrites, and size and texture of primary afferent terminal arbors. Anatomical manifestation of vibrissal representations within the BTC can be descried in nVp, nVi, and nVc, but not in nVo. Within the three subnuclei where they are found, anatomical vibrissal representations are composed of architectural subunits that form an overall pattern homeomorphic to the pattern of vibrissae on the face of the animal. Each sub-unit forms a cylindrical tube running in a rostrocaudal orientation within the BTC. These sub-units will be called barrelettes. Cytologically, each barrelette consists of cell-dense {\textquotedblleft}sides{\textquotedblright} surrounding a practically cell-free {\textquotedblleft}hollow{\textquotedblright} Individual sub-units are separated by narrow, cell-free {\textquotedblleft}septa{\textquotedblright} Histochemically, each subunit is manifested as a discrete patch of positive-staining reaction products. Differential interference contrast optics shows that these patches correspond precisely to the barrelette hollows. Evidence is presented to show that the barrelettes are the functional units for the processing of vibrissal sensory information. Terminal arborizations of individual primary afferents seem to be confined to the hollow of single barrelettes. The majority of neurons that form the sides of a barrelette have bitufted dendritic arbors, which project predominantly into the barrelette hollow, although a minority of neurons, particularly in nVi and nVc, also extend part of their dendritic arbors into adjacent barrelette hollows. The barrelette hollows are thus the principal neuropil region in which primary afferents and their target neurons interact. Contacts are made mainly between en passant varicosities and terminal boutons on primary afferent collaterals and dendritic spines and shafts of second order neurons. The confinement of primary afferent terminal arbors and second order neuronal dendrites within the hollow of a single barrelette is presumably the anatomical basis for the abundance of single-whisker units seen in electrophysiological recordings. Neurons with dendrites extending into the hollow of adjacent barrelettes may represent the physiologically multiwhisker units. Barrelettes may be a highly adaptive configuration that facilitate the transfer and integration of neural signals within a confined amount of neural tissues while still maintaining the topological arrangement of peripheral sense organs. Quantitative analyses show that, in nVp, the proportion of neural tissue allotted to the representation of each mystacial vibrissa is directly related to the innervation density of the vibrissal follicle: larger barrelettes correspond to more densely innervated vibrissae. There is no further change in this proportion between the barrelettes in nVp and the whisker barrels in the cortex.},

	abstract = {Brain map of touch sensation
The brain's somatosensory cortex contains a topographical map that reflects touch sensation inputs. During embryonic development, axons from the midbrain thalamus build columnar connections to the cortex in the absence of sensory input. Working in mice, Ant{\'o}n-Bola{\~n}os et al. found that these thalamocortical connections are responsible for organizing the somatosensory cortex (see the Perspective by Tiriac and Feller). Organization of the map in the cortex depends on spontaneous calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. Thus, the somatosensory map is sketched out before actual sensory input begins to refine the details.
Science, this issue p. 987; see also p. 933
The mammalian brain{\textquoteright}s somatosensory cortex is a topographic map of the body{\textquoteright}s sensory experience. In mice, cortical barrels reflect whisker input. We asked whether these cortical structures require sensory input to develop or are driven by intrinsic activity. Thalamocortical columns, connecting the thalamus to the cortex, emerge before sensory input and concur with calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. We show that the columnar organization of the thalamocortical somatotopic map exists in the mouse embryo before sensory input, thus linking spontaneous embryonic thalamic activity to somatosensory map formation. Without thalamic calcium waves, cortical circuits become hyperexcitable, columnar and barrel organization does not emerge, and the somatosensory map lacks anatomical and functional structure. Thus, a self-organized protomap in the embryonic thalamus drives the functional assembly of murine thalamocortical sensory circuits.
Mapping of touch sensation into brain regions is driven prenatally by spontaneous brain activity.

	abstract = {Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in distinct patterns in the forming cortex. EphA7 is expressed early in cortical development, becoming concentrated in anterior and posterior domains, whereas ephrin-A5 is expressed later in corticogenesis, highest in the middle region that has low levels of EphA7. The EphA7 gene produces full-length and truncated isoforms, which are repulsive and adhesive, respectively. Analysis of cortical RNA expression demonstrates that proportions of these isoforms change with time, from a more repulsive mix during embryogenesis to a more permissive mix postnatally. To examine how EphA7 and ephrin-A5 influence the formation of cortical regions, EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice were analyzed. Within the cortex of EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice, the distribution of ephrin-A5 was more extensive, encompassing its usual medial domain but also extending more posteriorly toward the occipital pole. Moreover, relative levels of ephrin-A5 along the cortex{\textquoteright}s anatomical axes changed in EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} animals, creating less striking shifts in ligand abundance. Furthermore, in vivo functional studies revealed that EphA7 exerts a repulsive influence on ephrin-A5expressing cells during corticogenesis. In contrast, EphA7 appears to mediate permissive interactions in the postnatal cortex: the area of somatosensory cortex was significantly reduced in EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice. A similar reduction was present in ephrin-A5{\textendash}/{\textendash} animals and a more pronounced decrease was observed in EphA7/ephrin-A5{\textendash}/{\textendash} cortex. Taken together, this study supports a role for EphA7 and ephrin-A5 in the establishment and maintenance of certain cortical domains and suggests that the nature of their interactions changes with cortical maturity.

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is parcellated into anatomically and functionally distinct areas. The establishment of area-specific neuronal diversity and circuit connectivity enables distinct neocortical regions to control diverse and specialized functional outputs, yet underlying molecular controls remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a central role for the transcriptional regulator Lim-only 4 (Lmo4) in establishing the diversity of neuronal subtypes within rostral mouse motor cortex, where projection neurons have particularly diverse and multi-projection connectivity compared with caudal motor cortex. In rostral motor cortex, we report that both subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), which send projections away from the cerebrum, and callosal projection neurons (CPN), which send projections to contralateral cortex, express Lmo4, whereas more caudal SCPN and CPN do not. Lmo4-expressing SCPN and CPN populations are comprised of multiple hodologically distinct subtypes. SCPN in rostral layer Va project largely to brainstem, whereas SCPN in layer Vb project largely to spinal cord, and a subset of both rostral SCPN and CPN sends second ipsilateral caudal (backward) projections in addition to primary projections. Without Lmo4 function, the molecular identity of neurons in rostral motor cortex is disrupted and more homogenous, rostral layer Va SCPN aberrantly project to the spinal cord, and many dual-projection SCPN and CPN fail to send a second backward projection. These molecular and hodological disruptions result in greater overall homogeneity of motor cortex output. Together, these results identify Lmo4 as a central developmental control over the diversity of motor cortex projection neuron subpopulations, establishing their area-specific identity and specialized connectivity.},

While progenitor-restricted factors broadly specify area identities in developing neocortex, the downstream regulatory elements involved in acquisition of those identities in postmitotic neurons are largely unknown. Here, we identify Bhlhb5, a transcription factor expressed in layers II{\textendash}V, as a postmitotic regulator of area identity. Bhlhb5 is initially expressed in a high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient that transforms into a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit aberrant expression of area-specific genes and structural organization in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. In somatosensory cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice display postsynaptic disorganization of vibrissal barrels. In caudal motor cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit anomalous differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons, accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation. Together, these results demonstrate Bhlhb5's function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization.},

	abstract = {The spatial organization of the anatomical structures along the trigeminal afferent pathway of the rat conserves the topographical order of the receptor sheath: The brainstem barrelettes, thalamic barreloids, and cortical barrels all reflect the arrangement of whiskers across the mystacial pad. Although both the amount of innervation in the mystacial pad and the size of cortical barrels were shown previously to exhibit increasing gradients toward the ventral and caudal whiskers, whether similar gradients existed in the brainstem and thalamus was not known. Here, the authors investigated the size gradients of the barreloids in the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. Because the angles used to cut the brain were crucial to this study, the optimal cutting angles were determined first for visualization of individual barreloids and of the entire barreloid field. Individual barreloids, arcs, and rows as well as entire barreloid fields were clearly visualized using cytochrome oxidase staining of brain slices that were cut with the optimal cutting angles. For the first five arcs (including straddlers), the length of barreloids increased in the direction of dorsal-to-ventral whiskers and of caudal-to-rostral whiskers. These gradients reveal an inverse relationship between the size of barreloids and whiskers (length and follicle diameter) along arcs and rows. The largest barreloids in the ventral posteromedial nucleus were those that represent whiskers C2{\textendash}C4, D2{\textendash}D4, and E2{\textendash}E4, which are neither the largest nor the most innervated whiskers in the mystacial pad. This implies that the extended representation is not merely a reflection of peripheral innervation biases and probably serves an as yet unknown processing function. J. Comp.

	abstract = {1. Extracellular spike recordings were made from single cells in various layers of barrel cortex in adult rats anesthetized with urethan. Response magnitude and latency differences to brief 1.14 degrees deflections of mystacial vibrissae of center (principal) and surround receptive-field vibrissae were measured. Latency differences for pairs of cells in the same penetration to stimulation of the principal vibrissa were also collected. In separate experiments the domains of layer IV cells were mapped for their influence by a single vibrissa and their latencies to this vibrissa were recorded. In all experiments precise locations of layer IV cells in each penetration were identified using dye-lesioning and cytochrome oxidase staining of tangential sections. 2. The results suggest that principal vibrissa data are relayed radially in a column of neurons before parallel relay to adjacent columns. To the principal vibrissa, layers IV and Vb neurons discharged earliest, with layers II and III on average 2 and 3 ms later, respectively. Serial relay from layers IV to III to II was suggested to be the most common event. Although layer Va cells fired next, a single-column organization is not suggested for them because differences in latency or response magnitude to their principal and immediate surround vibrissae were not significant. Layer II, III and IV cells showed no statistical difference in latency to the nearest surround vibrissa but fired significantly later than to their principal input. 3. Because, from our previous studies, surround receptive fields of barrel cells in rat S1 cortex appear to be constructed intracortically, these data suggest a parallel column-column relay for their construction. Horizontal relay between barrels occurred first within the septae between barrels. Mean intracortical transmission velocities were calculated at approximately 0.05 m/s for column-column information transfer.},

We show how these data are generally well explained by the theory of input-driven self-organization, with a family of computational models of cortical maps offering a parsimonious account for a wide range of map-related phenomena. We then discuss important challenges to this explanation, with respect to the maps present at birth, maps present under activity blockade, the limits of adult plasticity, and the lack of some maps in rodents. Because there is not at present another credible general theory for cortical map development, we conclude by proposing key experiments to help uncover other mechanisms that might also be operating during map development.},

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is organized into subdivisions referred to as areas that are distinguished from one another by differences in architecture, axonal connections, and function. The transcription factors EMX1, EMX2, and PAX6 have been proposed to regulate arealization. Emx1 and Emx2 are expressed by progenitor cells in a low rostrolateral to high caudomedial gradient across the embryonic neocortex, and Pax6 is expressed in a high rostrolateral to low caudomedial gradient. Recent evidence has suggested that EMX2 and PAX6 have a role in the genetic regulation of arealization. Here we use a panel of seven genes (Cad6, Cad8, Id2,RZR$\beta$, p75, EphA7, and ephrin-A5) representative of a broad range of proteins as complementary markers of positional identity to obtain a more thorough assessment of the suggested roles for EMX2 and PAX6 in arealization, and in addition to assess the proposed but untested role for EMX1 in arealization. Orderly changes in the size and positioning of domains of marker expression in Emx2 andPax6 mutants strongly imply that rostrolateral areas (motor and somatosensory) are expanded, whereas caudomedial areas (visual) are reduced in Emx2 mutants and that opposite effects occur in Pax6 mutants, consistent with their opposing gradients of expression. In contrast, patterns of marker expression, as well as the distribution of area-specific thalamocortical projections, appear normal in Emx1mutants, indicating that they do not exhibit changes in arealization. This lack of a defined role for EMX1 in arealization is supported by our finding of similar shifts in patterns of marker expression inEmx1; Emx2 double mutants as in Emx2 mutants. Thus, our findings indicate that EMX2 and PAX6 regulate, in opposing manners, arealization of the neocortex and impart positional identity to cortical cells, whereas EMX1 appears not to have a role in this process.},

Homozygous null mutation of either PLC-$\beta$1 or mGluR5 dramatically disrupts the cytoarchitectural differentiation of 'barrels' in the mouse somatosensory cortex, despite segregation in the pattern of thalamic innervation. Furthermore, group 1 mGluR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis is dramatically reduced in PLC-$\beta$1-/- mice during barrel development. Our data indicate that PLC-$\beta$1 activation via mGluR5 is critical for the coordinated development of the neocortex, and that presynaptic and postsynaptic components of cortical differentiation can be genetically dissociated.},

(2) has a consistent appearance from hemisphere to hemisphere, and (3) contains at least 220 barrels.

However, in contrast to other barrels in the rat barrel field and to the barrels that make up the PMBSF in the mouse, the PMBSF barrels in the rat are filled with small neurons nearly throughout the thickness of layer IV. From experimental evidence, it has been possible for the first time to establish consistent homologies between small groups of neocortical neurons in layer IV. The most surprising finding is that homologous barrels in the PMBSF of two closely related species, the rat and the mouse, have such a different cytoarchitectonic appearance. On the basis of this observation, we suggest that a careful study of these PMBSF barrels in the mouse, the rat and other species may provide a clue to understanding how neocortical neuronal circuits of varying complexity are assembled.},

	abstract = {What, if anything, is the functional significance of spatial patterning in cortical feature maps? We ask this question of four major theories of cortical map formation: self-organizing maps, wiring optimization, place coding, and reaction-diffusion. We argue that (i) self-organizing maps yield spatial patterning only as a by-product of efficient mechanisms for developing environmentally appropriate distributions of feature preferences, (ii) wiring optimization assumes rather than explains a map-like organization, (iii) place-coding mechanisms can at best explain only a subset of maps in functional terms, and (iv) reaction-diffusion models suggest two factors in the evolution of maps, the first based on efficient development of feature distributions, and the second based on generating feature-specific long-range recurrent cortical circuitry. None of these explanations for the existence of topological maps requires spatial patterning in maps to be useful. Thus despite these useful frameworks for understanding how maps form and how they are wired, the possibility that patterns are merely epiphenomena in the evolution of mammalian neocortex cannot be rejected. The article is intended as a nontechnical introduction to the assumptions and predictions of these four important classes of models, along with other possible functional explanations for maps. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Combined with cellular processes such as cell type specification, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, all of these developmental processes result in the establishment of an adult mammalian cortex with its typical lamination and regional patterning. By examining in-depth the role of one transcription factor, Pax6, on the regulation of cortical development, its integration in the regulation of chromatin state, and its regulation by cis-regulatory elements, we aim to demonstrate the importance of integrating each level of regulation in our understanding of cortical development.

The cortical area devoted to different regions, such as parts of the face or hands, reflects their functional importance. Here we investigated the role of genetically determined positional labels in neocortical mapping. Ephrin-A5 was expressed in a medial {\textgreater} lateral gradient across S1, whereas its receptor EphA4 was in a matching gradient across the thalamic ventrobasal (VB) complex, which provides S1 input. Ephrin-A5 had topographically specific effects on VB axon guidance in vitro. Ephrin-A5 gene disruption caused graded, topographically specific distortion in the S1 body map, with medial regions contracted and lateral regions expanded, changing relative areas up to 50\% in developing and adult mice. These results provide evidence for within-area thalamocortical mapping labels and show that a genetic difference can cause a lasting change in relative scale of different regions within a topographic map.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of connections of cortical afferents remain unclear. We report here that the Eph family tyrosine kinase receptor EphA5 and the ligand ephrin-A5 may play a key role in the exclusion of the limbic thalamic afferents from the sensorimotor cortex by mediating repulsive interactions. In situ hybridization shows that the EphA5 transcript is expressed at high levels in both cortical and subcortical limbic regions, including the frontal cortex, the subiculum, and the medial thalamic nuclei. In contrast, ephrin-A5 is transcribed abundantly in the sensorimotor cortex. Consistent with the complementary expression, the ligand inhibited dramatically the growth of neurites from neurons isolated from the medial thalamus but was permissive for the growth of neurites from lateral thalamic neurons, which is primarily nonlimbic. Similarly, the growth of neurites from Eph-A5-expressing neurons isolated from the subiculum was inhibited by ephrin-A5. Our studies suggest that the Eph family ligand ephrin-A5 serves as a general inhibitor of axonal growth from limbic neurons, which may serve to prevent innervation of inappropriate primary sensorimotor regions, thus contributing to the generation of specificity of thalamic cortical afferents.},

In addition, we show that the same ephrin/Eph genes unexpectedly control the inter-areal specificity of TC projections through the early topographic sorting of TC axons in an intermediate target, the ventral telencephalon. Our results constitute the first identification of guidance cues involved in inter-areal specificity of TC projections and demonstrate that the same set of mapping labels is used differentially for the generation of topographic specificity of TC projections between and within individual cortical areas.},

The same cues are re-used later to control the mapping of thalamocortical projections within a given cortical area, which strikingly illustrates how a limited set of genes can contribute to generate several levels of complexity of a neuronal network.},

	abstract = {The anatomy of the mammalian thalamus is characterized by nuclei, which can be readily identified in postnatal animals. However, the molecular mechanisms that guide specification and differentiation of neurons in specific thalamic nuclei are still largely unknown, and few molecular markers are available for most of these thalamic subregions at early stages of development. We therefore searched for patterned gene expression restricted to specific mouse thalamic regions by in situ hybridization during the onset of thalamic neurogenesis (embryonic [E] days E10.5--E12.5). To obtain correct regional information, we used Shh as a landmark and compared spatial relationships with the zona limitans intrathalamica (Zli), the border of the p2 and p3 compartments of the diencephalon. We identified genes that are expressed specifically in the ventricular zone of the thalamic neuroepithelium and also identified a number of genes that already exhibited regional identity at E12.5. Although many genes expressed in the mantle regions of the thalamus at E12.5 showed regionally restricted patterns, none of these clearly corresponded to individual thalamic nuclei. We next examined gene expression at E15.5, when thalamocortical axons (TCAs) project from distinct regions of the thalamus and reach their targets in the cerebral cortex. Regionally restricted patterns of gene expression were again seen for many genes, but some regionally bounded expression patterns in the early postnatal thalamus had shifted substantially by E15.5. These findings reveal that nucleogenesis in the developing thalamus is associated with selective and complex changes in gene expression and provide a list of genes that may actively regulate the development of thalamic nuclei.

	abstract = {The thalamus is essential for sensory perception. In mammals, work on the mouse has taught us most of what we know about how it develops and connects to the cortex. The mature thalamus of all mammalian species comprises numerous anatomically distinct collections of neurons called nuclei that differ in function, connectivity and molecular constitution. At the time of its initial appearance as a distinct structure following neural tube closure, the thalamus is already patterned by the regional expression of numerous regulatory genes. This patterning, which lays down the blueprint for later development of thalamic nuclei, predates the development of thalamocortical projections. In this review we apply novel analytical methods to gene expression data available in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas to highlight the complex organized molecular heterogeneity already present among cells in the thalamus from the earliest stages at which it contains differentiating neurons. This early patterning is likely to invest in axons growing from different parts of the thalamus the ability to navigate in an ordered way to their appropriate area in the cerebral cortex. We review the mechanisms and cues that thalamic axons use, encounter and interpret to attain the cortex. Mechanisms include guidance by previously-generated guidepost cells, such as those in the subpallium that maintain thalamic axonal order and direction, and axons such as those of reciprocal projections from intermediate structures or from the cortex itself back towards the thalamus. We show how thalamocortical pathfinding involves numerous guidance cues operating at a series of steps along their route. We stress the importance of the combinatorial actions of multiple genes for the development of the numerous specific identities and functions of cells in this exquisitely complex system and their orderly innervation of the cortex.},

Here, we report that the transcription factor Ctip1 functions in primary sensory areas to repress motor and activate sensory programs of gene expression, enabling establishment of sharp molecular boundaries defining functional areas. In Ctip1 mutants, abnormal gene expression leads to aberrantly motorized corticocortical and corticofugal output connectivity. Ctip1 critically regulates differentiation of layer IV neurons, and selective loss of Ctip1 in cortex deprives thalamocortical axons of their receptive ``sensory field'' in layer IV, which normally provides a tangentially and radially defined compartment of dedicated synaptic territory. Therefore, although thalamocortical axons invade appropriate cortical regions, they are unable to organize into properly configured sensory maps. Together, these data identify Ctip1 as a critical control over sensory area development.},

These combine three intertwined constraints: Firstly, fasciculation of the incoming axons; secondly, early neural activity; finally, molecular patterning. Sophisticated genetic manipulations in mice have now allowed dissecting these mechanisms with greater accuracy. Here we discuss some recent papers that provided novel insights into how these different mapping rules and constraints interact to shape the barrel map.},

Current findings indicate an interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic information relayed to cortex by thalamocortical input. Intrinsic mechanisms are based on morphogens and signaling molecules secreted by patterning centers, positioned at the perimeter of dorsal telencephalon, that generate across nascent cortex the graded expression of transcription factors in cortical progenitors. Two major patterning centers are the commissural plate, which expresses Fgf8 and Fgf17, and the cortical hem, which expresses Bmps and Wnts. Four transcription factors, COUP-TFI, Emx2, Pax6, and Sp8, with graded expression across the embryonic cortical axes, are shown to determine sizes and positions of cortical areas by specifying or repressing area identities within cortical progenitors. They also interact to modify their expression, as well as expression of Fgf8. We review these mechanisms of arealization and discuss models and concepts of cortical area patterning.},

	abstract = {Corticothalamic (CT) feedback outnumbers thalamocortical projections and regulates sensory information processing at the level of the thalamus. It is well established that EphA7, a member of EphA receptor family, is involved in the topographic mapping of CT projections. The aim of the present study was to dissect the precise impact of EphA7 on each step of CT growth. We used in utero electroporation-mediated EphA7 overexpression in developing somatosensory CT axons to dissect EphA7/ephrin-A-dependent mechanisms involved in regulating both initial targeting and postnatal growth of the CT projections. Our data revealed that topographic maps of cortical afferents in the ventrobasal complex and medial part of the posterior complex in the thalamus become discernible shortly after birth and are fully established by the second postnatal week. This process starts with the direct ingrowth of the CT axons to the designated areas within target thalamic nuclei and by progressive increase of axonal processes in the terminal zones. Large-scale overproduction and elimination of exuberant widespread axonal branches outside the target zone was not observed. Each developmental event was coordinated by spatially and temporally different responsiveness of CT axons to the ephrin-A gradient in thalamic nuclei, as well as by the matching levels of EphA7 in CT axons and ephrin-As in thalamic nuclei. These results support the concept that the topographic connections between the maps in the cerebral cortex and corresponding thalamic nuclei are genetically prespecified to a large extent, and established by precise spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms that involve the Eph family of genes.

Evidence is accumulating that members of the FGF gene family provide signals that act locally to regulate growth and patterning in vertebrate embryos. In this report, we provide a detailed analysis of the mouse Fgf8 gene. We have mapped the Fgf8 locus to the distal region of mouse chromosome 19, and sequenced the 5' coding region of the gene. Our data identify a new coding exon, and locate multiple splice donor and splice acceptor sites that can be used to produce at least seven transcripts encoding a family of secreted FGF8 proteins with different N termini. From these results, it appears that Fgf8 is structurally the most complex member of the FGF family described to date. In the embryo, many of the regions in which Fgf8 RNA is localized are known to direct outgrowth and patterning, including the apical ectodermal ridge of the limb bud, the primitive streak and tail bud, the surface ectoderm overlying the facial primorida and the midbrain-hindbrain junction, suggesting that FGF8 may be a component of the regulatory signals that emanate from these regions.},
