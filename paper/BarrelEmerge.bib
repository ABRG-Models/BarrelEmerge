There is growing experimental evidence that their emergence and development is controlled by both epigenetic and genetic factors. The latter were recently implicated as dominating the early cortical area specification. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that explicitly considers the genetic factors and that is able to explain several sets of experiments on cortical area regulation involving transcription factors Emx2 and Pax6, and fibroblast growth factor FGF8. The model consists of the dynamics of thalamo-cortical connections modulated by signaling molecules that are regulated genetically, and by axonal competition for neocortical space. The model can make predictions and provides a basic mathematical framework for the early development of the thalamo-cortical connections and area patterning that can be further refined as more experimental facts become known.},

Intrinsic, activity-independent and extrinsic, activity-dependent mechanisms are involved in the development of neocortical areas and their connections. The intrinsic molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of this sophisticated network are not fully understood. In this report (I) and the companion report (II), we present the first lifespan analysis of ipsilateral intraneocortical connections (INCs) among multiple sensory and motor regions, from the embryonic period to adulthood in the mouse. Additionally, we characterize the neocortical expression patterns of several developmentally regulated genes that are of central importance to studies investigating the molecular control of arealization from embryonic day 13.5 to postnatal day (P) 3 (I) and P6 to 50 (II).

The visual, somatosensory and auditory cortical maps are established during a critical period in development. Throughout this window in time, the developing cortical maps are vulnerable to deleterious effects of sense organ damage or sensory deprivation. The rodent barrel cortex offers an invaluable model system with which to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of topographic maps and their plasticity during development. Five rows of mystacial vibrissa (whisker) follicles on the snout and an array of sinus hairs are represented by layer IV neural modules ({\textquoteleft}barrels{\textquoteright}) and thalamocortical axon terminals in the primary somatosensory cortex. Perinatal damage to the whiskers or the sensory nerve innervating them irreversibly alters the structural organization of the barrels. Earlier studies emphasized the role of the sensory periphery in dictating whisker-specific brain maps and patterns. Recent advances in molecular genetics and analyses of genetically altered mice allow new insights into neural pattern formation in the neocortex and the mechanisms underlying critical period plasticity. Here, we review the development and patterning of the barrel cortex and the critical period plasticity.},

	abstract = {The thalamocortical projection to rodent somatosensory ({\textquotedblleft}barrell{\textquotedblright}) cortex is highly ordered in both the radial and the tangential dimensions. During a brief period of postnatal development, thalamocortical axons establish two tiers of terminations, in the deep layers and in layer IV, and form whisker-specific clusters within layer IV; however, little is known about the cues that guide them to their appropriate radial and tangential positions. To gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying this process, we studied the development of thalamocortical termination patterns in mouse barrel cortex at high spatial resolution. Developing thalamocortical axons were labeled in fixed slices with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye Dil and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope. On the day of birth (postnatal day 0, P0) axons coursed through layers VI and V, with little or no branching. By P2 the lower tier of terminations, at the border of layers VI and V, was clearly identifiable. Below this tier axons coursed obliquely or tangentially, forming a dense meshwork of intersecting fibers, but with no apparent branching. By P4 the upper tier of terminations, in layer IV, was clearly recognizable, and consisted of periodic, dense clusters of terminal arborizations. In marked contrast to the oblique and apparently disorderly course followed by axons in layer VI and lower layer V, axons in upper layer V heading toward the upper tier were organized in loose bundles running radially, suggesting that axons destined to terminate in a particular layer IV barrel had already reached their appropriate tangential coordinates within the lower tier. Thus, the pattern of thalamocortical terminations in layer IV seems to be projected from the deep tier of terminations, and does not develop from an initially profuse arborization pattern through pruning of inappropriate branches.},

	abstract = {In the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, the thalamocortical axons (TCAs) are organized into clusters that correspond to functional units in the periphery. Around these axons, neurons in layer IV aggregate as barrels. To understand how this organization emerges, we analyzed TCA development in mice that do not form barrels, the monoamine oxidase A knock-out (MAOA-KO), and in MAOA/5-HT1Breceptor double-KO mice, which have a restored barrel field. We show that TCAs already attain cortical layer IV on the day of birth. They are uniformly distributed in this layer from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P2 and secondarily coalesce into barrel domains in layer IV, over a 3 d period (P3{\textendash}P5), with no prepatterning in the deeper layers. In MAOA-KO mice, the uniform distribution of the TC projection is maintained, and no axon clusters emerge. Individual TCA arbors were traced after carbocyanine injections. At P1, TCAs were poorly branched and covered variable tangential widths, encompassing one to two prospective barrels. At P7 the number of TCA branches increased 10-fold in layer IV and became restricted to one barrel. In MAOA-KO mice, there was a 50\% reduction of the TCA terminal branches in layer IV, with a 40\% increase in their tangential extent. These defects were corrected in the MAOA/5-HT1B double knock-out mice, indicating an effect of the presynaptic 5-HT1B receptor on axon branching. Our results indicate that the barrel-deficient phenotype of MAOA-KO mice results from an altered refinement of the TCA arbors in their target layer IV, involving branch elaboration and collateral retraction during early postnatal life.},

	abstract = {Telencephalic patterning centers, defined by the discrete expression domains of distinct morphogens, Fgf s in the commissural plate (CoP), Wnt s and Bmp s in the cortical hem, and a ventral domain of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are postulated to establish during development the initial patterning of the telencepahlon, including the neocortex. We show that the expression patterns of Sp5, Sp8, and Sp9, members of the Sp8-like family that are homologues of Drosophila buttonhead, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on Sp8, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of Fgf8, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used in utero electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between Sp8 and Fgf8 and their roles in cortical area patterning. We show that Fgf8 and Sp8 exhibit reciprocal induction in vivo in the embryonic telencephalon. Sp8 also induces downstream targets of Fgf8, including ETS transcription factors. In vitro assays show that Sp8 binds Fgf8 regulatory elements and is a direct transcriptional activator of Fgf8. We also show that Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is repressed by Emx2 in vitro, suggesting a mechanism to limit Fgf8 expression to the CoP. In vivo expression of a dominant negative Sp8 in the CoP indicates that Sp8 maintains expression of Fgf8 and also its effect on area patterning. Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of Sp8 on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of Fgf8, suggesting that in parallel to regulating Fgf8 expression, Sp8 also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning. In summary, Sp8 and Fgf8 robustly induce one another, and may act to balance the anterior-posterior area patterning of the cortex.},

	abstract = {Brain map of touch sensation
The brain's somatosensory cortex contains a topographical map that reflects touch sensation inputs. During embryonic development, axons from the midbrain thalamus build columnar connections to the cortex in the absence of sensory input. Working in mice, Ant{\'o}n-Bola{\~n}os et al. found that these thalamocortical connections are responsible for organizing the somatosensory cortex (see the Perspective by Tiriac and Feller). Organization of the map in the cortex depends on spontaneous calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. Thus, the somatosensory map is sketched out before actual sensory input begins to refine the details.
Science, this issue p. 987; see also p. 933
The mammalian brain{\textquoteright}s somatosensory cortex is a topographic map of the body{\textquoteright}s sensory experience. In mice, cortical barrels reflect whisker input. We asked whether these cortical structures require sensory input to develop or are driven by intrinsic activity. Thalamocortical columns, connecting the thalamus to the cortex, emerge before sensory input and concur with calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. We show that the columnar organization of the thalamocortical somatotopic map exists in the mouse embryo before sensory input, thus linking spontaneous embryonic thalamic activity to somatosensory map formation. Without thalamic calcium waves, cortical circuits become hyperexcitable, columnar and barrel organization does not emerge, and the somatosensory map lacks anatomical and functional structure. Thus, a self-organized protomap in the embryonic thalamus drives the functional assembly of murine thalamocortical sensory circuits.
Mapping of touch sensation into brain regions is driven prenatally by spontaneous brain activity.

	abstract = {Summary
While progenitor-restricted factors broadly specify area identities in developing neocortex, the downstream regulatory elements involved in acquisition of those identities in postmitotic neurons are largely unknown. Here, we identify Bhlhb5, a transcription factor expressed in layers II{\textendash}V, as a postmitotic regulator of area identity. Bhlhb5 is initially expressed in a high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient that transforms into a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit aberrant expression of area-specific genes and structural organization in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. In somatosensory cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice display postsynaptic disorganization of vibrissal barrels. In caudal motor cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit anomalous differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons, accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation. Together, these results demonstrate Bhlhb5's function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization.},

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is parcellated into anatomically and functionally distinct areas. The establishment of area-specific neuronal diversity and circuit connectivity enables distinct neocortical regions to control diverse and specialized functional outputs, yet underlying molecular controls remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a central role for the transcriptional regulator Lim-only 4 (Lmo4) in establishing the diversity of neuronal subtypes within rostral mouse motor cortex, where projection neurons have particularly diverse and multi-projection connectivity compared with caudal motor cortex. In rostral motor cortex, we report that both subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), which send projections away from the cerebrum, and callosal projection neurons (CPN), which send projections to contralateral cortex, express Lmo4, whereas more caudal SCPN and CPN do not. Lmo4-expressing SCPN and CPN populations are comprised of multiple hodologically distinct subtypes. SCPN in rostral layer Va project largely to brainstem, whereas SCPN in layer Vb project largely to spinal cord, and a subset of both rostral SCPN and CPN sends second ipsilateral caudal (backward) projections in addition to primary projections. Without Lmo4 function, the molecular identity of neurons in rostral motor cortex is disrupted and more homogenous, rostral layer Va SCPN aberrantly project to the spinal cord, and many dual-projection SCPN and CPN fail to send a second backward projection. These molecular and hodological disruptions result in greater overall homogeneity of motor cortex output. Together, these results identify Lmo4 as a central developmental control over the diversity of motor cortex projection neuron subpopulations, establishing their area-specific identity and specialized connectivity.},

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex contains an intricate processing network of multiple sensory and motor areas that allows the animal to engage in complex behaviors. These anatomically and functionally unique areas and their distinct connections arise during early development, through a process termed arealization. Both intrinsic, activity-independent and extrinsic, activity-dependent mechanisms drive arealization, much of which occurs during the areal patterning period (APP) from late embryogenesis to early postnatal life. How areal boundaries and their connections develop and change from infancy to adulthood is not known. Additionally, the adult patterns of sensory and motor ipsilateral intraneocortical connections (INCs) have not been thoroughly characterized in the mouse. In this report and its companion (I), we present the first lifespan analysis of ipsilateral INCs among multiple sensory and motor regions in mouse. We describe the neocortical expression patterns of several developmentally regulated genes that are of central importance to studies investigating the molecular regulation of arealization, from postnatal day (P) 6 to P50. In this study, we correlate the boundaries of gene expression patterns with developing areal boundaries across a lifespan, in order to better understand the nature of gene--areal relationships from early postnatal life to adulthood.},

	abstract = {Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in distinct patterns in the forming cortex. EphA7 is expressed early in cortical development, becoming concentrated in anterior and posterior domains, whereas ephrin-A5 is expressed later in corticogenesis, highest in the middle region that has low levels of EphA7. The EphA7 gene produces full-length and truncated isoforms, which are repulsive and adhesive, respectively. Analysis of cortical RNA expression demonstrates that proportions of these isoforms change with time, from a more repulsive mix during embryogenesis to a more permissive mix postnatally. To examine how EphA7 and ephrin-A5 influence the formation of cortical regions, EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice were analyzed. Within the cortex of EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice, the distribution of ephrin-A5 was more extensive, encompassing its usual medial domain but also extending more posteriorly toward the occipital pole. Moreover, relative levels of ephrin-A5 along the cortex{\textquoteright}s anatomical axes changed in EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} animals, creating less striking shifts in ligand abundance. Furthermore, in vivo functional studies revealed that EphA7 exerts a repulsive influence on ephrin-A5expressing cells during corticogenesis. In contrast, EphA7 appears to mediate permissive interactions in the postnatal cortex: the area of somatosensory cortex was significantly reduced in EphA7{\textendash}/{\textendash} mice. A similar reduction was present in ephrin-A5{\textendash}/{\textendash} animals and a more pronounced decrease was observed in EphA7/ephrin-A5{\textendash}/{\textendash} cortex. Taken together, this study supports a role for EphA7 and ephrin-A5 in the establishment and maintenance of certain cortical domains and suggests that the nature of their interactions changes with cortical maturity.

	abstract = {What, if anything, is the functional significance of spatial patterning in cortical feature maps? We ask this question of four major theories of cortical map formation: self-organizing maps, wiring optimization, place coding, and reaction-diffusion. We argue that (i) self-organizing maps yield spatial patterning only as a by-product of efficient mechanisms for developing environmentally appropriate distributions of feature preferences, (ii) wiring optimization assumes rather than explains a map-like organization, (iii) place-coding mechanisms can at best explain only a subset of maps in functional terms, and (iv) reaction-diffusion models suggest two factors in the evolution of maps, the first based on efficient development of feature distributions, and the second based on generating feature-specific long-range recurrent cortical circuitry. None of these explanations for the existence of topological maps requires spatial patterning in maps to be useful. Thus despite these useful frameworks for understanding how maps form and how they are wired, the possibility that patterns are merely epiphenomena in the evolution of mammalian neocortex cannot be rejected. The article is intended as a nontechnical introduction to the assumptions and predictions of these four important classes of models, along with other possible functional explanations for maps. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

(2) has a consistent appearance from hemisphere to hemisphere, and (3) contains at least 220 barrels.

However, in contrast to other barrels in the rat barrel field and to the barrels that make up the PMBSF in the mouse, the PMBSF barrels in the rat are filled with small neurons nearly throughout the thickness of layer IV. From experimental evidence, it has been possible for the first time to establish consistent homologies between small groups of neocortical neurons in layer IV. The most surprising finding is that homologous barrels in the PMBSF of two closely related species, the rat and the mouse, have such a different cytoarchitectonic appearance. On the basis of this observation, we suggest that a careful study of these PMBSF barrels in the mouse, the rat and other species may provide a clue to understanding how neocortical neuronal circuits of varying complexity are assembled.},

Homozygous null mutation of either PLC-$\beta$1 or mGluR5 dramatically disrupts the cytoarchitectural differentiation of 'barrels' in the mouse somatosensory cortex, despite segregation in the pattern of thalamic innervation. Furthermore, group 1 mGluR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis is dramatically reduced in PLC-$\beta$1-/- mice during barrel development. Our data indicate that PLC-$\beta$1 activation via mGluR5 is critical for the coordinated development of the neocortex, and that presynaptic and postsynaptic components of cortical differentiation can be genetically dissociated.},

	abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is organized into subdivisions referred to as areas that are distinguished from one another by differences in architecture, axonal connections, and function. The transcription factors EMX1, EMX2, and PAX6 have been proposed to regulate arealization. Emx1 and Emx2 are expressed by progenitor cells in a low rostrolateral to high caudomedial gradient across the embryonic neocortex, and Pax6 is expressed in a high rostrolateral to low caudomedial gradient. Recent evidence has suggested that EMX2 and PAX6 have a role in the genetic regulation of arealization. Here we use a panel of seven genes (Cad6, Cad8, Id2,RZR$\beta$, p75, EphA7, and ephrin-A5) representative of a broad range of proteins as complementary markers of positional identity to obtain a more thorough assessment of the suggested roles for EMX2 and PAX6 in arealization, and in addition to assess the proposed but untested role for EMX1 in arealization. Orderly changes in the size and positioning of domains of marker expression in Emx2 andPax6 mutants strongly imply that rostrolateral areas (motor and somatosensory) are expanded, whereas caudomedial areas (visual) are reduced in Emx2 mutants and that opposite effects occur in Pax6 mutants, consistent with their opposing gradients of expression. In contrast, patterns of marker expression, as well as the distribution of area-specific thalamocortical projections, appear normal in Emx1mutants, indicating that they do not exhibit changes in arealization. This lack of a defined role for EMX1 in arealization is supported by our finding of similar shifts in patterns of marker expression inEmx1; Emx2 double mutants as in Emx2 mutants. Thus, our findings indicate that EMX2 and PAX6 regulate, in opposing manners, arealization of the neocortex and impart positional identity to cortical cells, whereas EMX1 appears not to have a role in this process.},

	abstract = {The contribution of extrinsic and genetic mechanisms in determining areas of the mammalian neocortex has been a contested issue. This study analyzes the roles of the regulatory genesEmx2 and Pax6, which are expressed in opposing gradients in the neocortical ventricular zone, in specifying areas. Changes in the patterning of molecular markers and area-specific connections between the cortex and thalamus suggest that arealization of the neocortex is disproportionately altered in Emx2 andPax6 mutant mice in opposing manners predicted from their countergradients of expression: rostral areas expand and caudal areas contract in Emx2 mutants, whereas the opposite effect is seen in Pax6 mutants. These findings suggest thatEmx2 and Pax6 cooperate to regulate arealization of the neocortex and to confer area identity to cortical cells.},

	abstract = {In this article, we review functional organization in sensory cortical regions{\textemdash}how the cortex represents the world. We consider four interrelated aspects of cortical organization: (1) the set of receptive fields of individual cortical sensory neurons, (2) how lateral interaction between cortical neurons reflects the similarity of their receptive fields, (3) the spatial distribution of receptive-field properties across the horizontal extent of the cortical tissue, and (4) how the spatial distributions of different receptive-field properties interact with one another. We show how these data are generally well explained by the theory of input-driven self-organization, with a family of computational models of cortical maps offering a parsimonious account for a wide range of map-related phenomena. We then discuss important challenges to this explanation, with respect to the maps present at birth, maps present under activity blockade, the limits of adult plasticity, and the lack of some maps in rodents. Because there is not at present another credible general theory for cortical map development, we conclude by proposing key experiments to help uncover other mechanisms that might also be operating during map development.},

	abstract = {1. Extracellular spike recordings were made from single cells in various layers of barrel cortex in adult rats anesthetized with urethan. Response magnitude and latency differences to brief 1.14 degrees deflections of mystacial vibrissae of center (principal) and surround receptive-field vibrissae were measured. Latency differences for pairs of cells in the same penetration to stimulation of the principal vibrissa were also collected. In separate experiments the domains of layer IV cells were mapped for their influence by a single vibrissa and their latencies to this vibrissa were recorded. In all experiments precise locations of layer IV cells in each penetration were identified using dye-lesioning and cytochrome oxidase staining of tangential sections. 2. The results suggest that principal vibrissa data are relayed radially in a column of neurons before parallel relay to adjacent columns. To the principal vibrissa, layers IV and Vb neurons discharged earliest, with layers II and III on average 2 and 3 ms later, respectively. Serial relay from layers IV to III to II was suggested to be the most common event. Although layer Va cells fired next, a single-column organization is not suggested for them because differences in latency or response magnitude to their principal and immediate surround vibrissae were not significant. Layer II, III and IV cells showed no statistical difference in latency to the nearest surround vibrissa but fired significantly later than to their principal input. 3. Because, from our previous studies, surround receptive fields of barrel cells in rat S1 cortex appear to be constructed intracortically, these data suggest a parallel column-column relay for their construction. Horizontal relay between barrels occurred first within the septae between barrels. Mean intracortical transmission velocities were calculated at approximately 0.05 m/s for column-column information transfer.},

	abstract = {The spatial organization of the anatomical structures along the trigeminal afferent pathway of the rat conserves the topographical order of the receptor sheath: The brainstem barrelettes, thalamic barreloids, and cortical barrels all reflect the arrangement of whiskers across the mystacial pad. Although both the amount of innervation in the mystacial pad and the size of cortical barrels were shown previously to exhibit increasing gradients toward the ventral and caudal whiskers, whether similar gradients existed in the brainstem and thalamus was not known. Here, the authors investigated the size gradients of the barreloids in the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. Because the angles used to cut the brain were crucial to this study, the optimal cutting angles were determined first for visualization of individual barreloids and of the entire barreloid field. Individual barreloids, arcs, and rows as well as entire barreloid fields were clearly visualized using cytochrome oxidase staining of brain slices that were cut with the optimal cutting angles. For the first five arcs (including straddlers), the length of barreloids increased in the direction of dorsal-to-ventral whiskers and of caudal-to-rostral whiskers. These gradients reveal an inverse relationship between the size of barreloids and whiskers (length and follicle diameter) along arcs and rows. The largest barreloids in the ventral posteromedial nucleus were those that represent whiskers C2{\textendash}C4, D2{\textendash}D4, and E2{\textendash}E4, which are neither the largest nor the most innervated whiskers in the mystacial pad. This implies that the extended representation is not merely a reflection of peripheral innervation biases and probably serves an as yet unknown processing function. J. Comp.
