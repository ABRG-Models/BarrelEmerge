# Lab notes

The file supp.tex contains notes written while developing this
model. It began life in another repository, and some of the references
in the document are to files in that repository. However, it documents
the ideas behind this work and how the model developed.

Note that it's *not* a "Supplementary Text" section published
alongside the paper.
