# Lab notes

The file supp.tex contains notes written while developing this
model. It began life in another repository, and some of the references
in the document are to files in that repository. However, it documents
the ideas behind this work and how the model developed.

Note that although it's *not* a "Supplementary Text" section published
alongside the eLife paper, some of the content of this document was
adapted to form the *Materials & Methods* section of the paper.
