 \dropcap{S}patial patterns in neural connectivity provide clues about the constraints under which brains evolve and develop \citep{purves_iterated_1992}. Perhaps the most distinctive pattern can be found in the rodent barrel cortex \cite{woolsey_structural_1970}. The barrels are large cortical columns, identifiable from birth in layer 4 of primary somatosensory cortex as dense clusters of thalamocortical axons, which are enclosed by borders a few neurons thick from postnatal day 3 \citep{erzurumlu_development_2012}. In the plane tangential to the cortical surface the barrels constitute a somatotopic map of the whiskers, with cells of adjacent barrels responding most strongly and quickly to deflection of adjacent whiskers \citep{armstrong-james_flow_1992}. Barrel patterning reflects subcortical whisker maps comprising cell aggregates called barrelettes in the brainstem and barreloids in the thalamus \cite{van_der_loos_barreloids_1976}.
