Dear Dr. James,

Thank you for submitting your appeal. I am very sorry to say that, after careful deliberation by the Editorial Board, your appeal has been declined. The Editor's decision to decline your submission remains unchanged, and we are therefore unable to consider a resubmission of this paper.

We hope you will consider submitting future work to PNAS.

Sincerely yours,

May R. Berenbaum
Editor-in-Chief
